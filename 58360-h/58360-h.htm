have done much for Egyptian folk-lore and you can do much more. This

  <h2 class='c011'>MA’ARUF THE COBBLER AND HIS WIFE FATIMAH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There dwelt once upon a time in the God-guarded city of Cairo
a cobbler who lived by patching old shoes.<a id='r1' href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> His name was
Ma’aruf<a id='r2' href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and he had a wife called Fatimah, whom the folk had
nicknamed “The Dung;”<a id='r3' href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> for that she was a whorish, worthless
wretch, scanty of shame and mickle of mischief. She ruled her
spouse and used to abuse him and curse him a thousand times a
day; and he feared her malice and dreaded her misdoings; for
that he was a sensible man and careful of his repute, but poor-conditioned.
When he earned much, he spent it on her, and
when he gained little, she revenged herself on his body that night,
leaving him no peace and making his night black as her book;<a id='r4' href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
for she was even as of one like her saith the poet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How manifold nights have I passed with my wife ✿ In the saddest plight with all misery rife:</div>
      <div class='line'>Would Heaven when first I went in to her ✿ With a cup of cold poison I’d ta’en her life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Amongst other afflictions which befel him from her one day she
said to him, “O Ma’aruf, I wish thee to bring me this night a
vermicelli-cake dressed with bees’ honey.”<a id='r5' href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> He replied, “So Allah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Almighty aid me to its price, I will bring it thee. By Allah, I
have no dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy.”<a id='r6' href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Rejoined she,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class='ph3'>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
Ma’aruf the Cobbler said to his spouse, “If Allah aid me to its
price, I will bring it to thee this night. By Allah, I have no
dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy to me!” She
rejoined, “I wot naught of these words; whether He aid thee or
aid thee not, look thou come not to me save with the vermicelli
and bees’ honey; and if thou come without it I will make thy
night black as thy fortune whenas thou marriedst me and fellest
into my hand.” Quoth he, “Allah is bountiful!” and going out
with grief scattering itself from his body, prayed the dawn-prayer
and opened his shop, saying, “I beseech thee, O Lord, to vouchsafe
me the price of the Kunafah and ward off from me the mischief of
yonder wicked woman this night!” After which he sat in the
shop till noon, but no work came to him and his fear of his wife
redoubled. Then he arose and locking his shop, went out perplexed
as to how he should do in the matter of the vermicelli-cake,
seeing he had not even the wherewithal to buy bread. Presently
he came up to the shop of the Kunafah-seller and stood before it
distraught, whilst his eyes brimmed with tears. The pastry-cook
glanced at him and said, “O Master Ma’aruf, why dost thou weep?
Tell me what hath befallen thee.” So he acquainted him with his
case, saying, “My wife is a shrew, a virago who would have me
bring her a Kunafah; but I have sat in my shop till past
mid-day and have not gained even the price of bread; wherefore
I am in fear of her.” The cook laughed and said, “No harm shall
come to thee. How many pounds wilt thou have?” “Five
pounds,” answered Ma’aruf. So the man weighed him out five
pounds of vermicelli-cake and said to him, “I have clarified butter,
but no bees’ honey. Here is drip-honey,<a id='r7' href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> however, which is better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>than bees’ honey; and what harm will there be, if it be with drip-honey?”
Ma’aruf was ashamed to object, because the pastry-cook
was to have patience with him for the price, and said, “Give
it me with drip-honey.” So he fried a vermicelli-cake for him with
butter and drenched it with drip-honey, till it was fit to present to
Kings. Then he asked him, “Dost thou want bread<a id='r8' href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and
cheese?”; and Ma’aruf answered, “Yes.” So he gave him four
half dirhams worth of bread and one of cheese, and the vermicelli
was ten nusfs. Then said he, “Know, O Ma’aruf, that thou owest
me fifteen nusfs; so go to thy wife and make merry and take this
nusf for the Hammam;<a id='r9' href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and thou shalt have credit for a day or
two or three till Allah provide thee with thy daily bread. And
straiten not thy wife, for I will have patience with thee till such
time as thou shalt have dirhams to spare.” So Ma’aruf took the
vermicelli-cake and bread and cheese and went away, with a
heart at ease, blessing the pastry-cook and saying, “Extolled be
Thy perfection, O my Lord! How bountiful art Thou!” When
he came home, his wife enquired of him, “Hast thou brought the
vermicelli-cake?”; and, replying “Yes,” he set it before her.
She looked at it and seeing that it was dressed with cane-honey,<a id='r10' href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
said to him, “Did I not bid thee bring it with bees’ honey? Wilt
thou contrary my wish and have it dressed with cane-honey?”
He excused himself to her, saying, “I bought it not save on credit;”
but said she, “This talk is idle; I will not eat Kunafah save with
bees’ honey.” And she was wroth with it and threw it in his face,
saying, “Begone, thou pimp, and bring me other than this!”
Then she dealt him a buffet on the cheek and knocked out one of
his teeth. The blood ran down upon his breast and for stress of
anger he smote her on the head a single blow and a slight;
whereupon she clutched his beard and fell to shouting out and
saying, “Help, O Moslems!” So the neighbours came in and
freed his beard from her grip; then they reproved and reproached
her, saying, “We are all content to eat Kunafah with cane-honey.
Why, then, wilt thou oppress this poor man thus? Verily, this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>disgraceful in thee!” And they went on to soothe her till they
made peace between her and him. But, when the folk were gone,
she sware that she would not eat of the vermicelli, and Ma’aruf,
burning with hunger, said in himself, “She sweareth that she will
not eat; so I will e’en eat.” Then he ate, and when she saw
him eating, she said, “Inshallah, may the eating of it be poison
to destroy the far one’s body.”<a id='r11' href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Quoth he, “It shall not be
at thy bidding,” and went on eating, laughing and saying,
“Thou swarest that thou wouldst not eat of this; but Allah is
bountiful, and to-morrow night, an the Lord decree, I will
bring thee Kunafah dressed with bees’ honey, and thou shalt eat it
alone.” And he applied himself to appeasing her, whilst she
called down curses upon him; and she ceased not to rail at him
and revile him with gross abuse till the morning, when she bared
her forearm to beat him. Quoth he, “Give me time and I will
bring thee other vermicelli-cake.” Then he went out to the
mosque and prayed, after which he betook himself to his shop and
opening it, sat down; but hardly had he done this when up came
two runners from the Kazi’s court and said to him, “Up with thee,
speak with the Kazi, for thy wife hath complained of thee to him
and her favour is thus and thus.” He recognised her by their
description; and saying, “May Allah Almighty torment her!”
walked with them till he came to the Kazi’s presence, where he
found Fatimah standing with her arm bound up and her face-veil
besmeared with blood; and she was weeping and wiping away her
tears. Quoth the Kazi, “Ho man, hast thou no fear of Allah the
Most High? Why hast thou beaten this good woman and broken
her forearm and knocked out her tooth and entreated her thus?”
And quoth Ma’aruf, “If I beat her or put out her tooth, sentence
me to what thou wilt; but in truth the case was thus and thus and
the neighbours made peace between me and her.” And he told
him the story from first to last. Now this Kazi was a benevolent
man; so he brought out to him a quarter dinar, saying, “O man,
take this and get her Kunafah with bees’ honey and do ye make
peace, thou and she.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “Give it to her.” So she
took it and the Kazi made peace between them, saying, “O wife,
obey thy husband; and thou, O man, deal kindly with her.<a id='r12' href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Then they left the court, reconciled at the Kazi’s hands, and the
woman went one way, whilst her husband returned by another way
to his shop and sat there, when, behold, the runners came up to
him and said, “Give us our fee.” Quoth he, “The Kazi took not
of me aught; on the contrary, he gave me a quarter dinar.” But
quoth they, “’Tis no concern of ours whether the Kazi took of
thee or gave to thee, and if thou give us not our fee, we will exact
it in despite of thee.” And they fell to dragging him about the
market; so he sold his tools and gave them half a dinar, whereupon
they let him go and went away, whilst he put his hand to his cheek
and sat sorrowful, for that he had no tools wherewith to work.
Presently, up came two ill-favoured fellows and said to him,
“Come, O man, and speak with the Kazi; for thy wife hath complained
of thee to him.” Said he, “He made peace between us
just now.” But said they, “We come from another Kazi, and thy
wife hath complained of thee to our Kazi.” So he arose and went
with them to their Kazi, calling on Allah for aid against her; and
when he saw her, he said to her, “Did we not make peace, good
woman?” Whereupon she cried, “There abideth no peace between
me and thee.” Accordingly he came forward and told the
Kazi his story, adding, “And indeed the Kazi Such-an-one made
peace between us this very hour.” Whereupon the Kazi said to
her, “O strumpet, since ye two have made peace with each other,
why comest thou to me complaining?” Quoth she, “He beat me
after that;” but quoth the Kazi, “Make peace each with other,
and beat her not again, and she will cross thee no more.” So they
made peace and the Kazi said to Ma’aruf, “Give the runners their
fee.” So he gave them their fee and going back to his shop,
opened it and sat down, as he were a drunken man for excess of
the chagrin which befel him. Presently, while he was still sitting,
behold, a man came up to him and said, “O Ma’aruf, rise and
hide thyself, for thy wife hath complained of thee to the High
Court<a id='r13' href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and Abú Tabak<a id='r14' href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> is after thee.” So he shut his shop and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>fled towards the Gate of Victory.<a id='r15' href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> He had five Nusfs of silver
left of the price of the lasts and gear; and therewith he bought
four worth of bread and one of cheese, as he fled from her. Now
it was the winter season and the hour of mid-afternoon prayer; so,
when he came out among the rubbish-mounds the rain descended
upon him, like water from the mouths of water-skins, and his
clothes were drenched. He therefore entered the ‘Ádiliyah,<a id='r16' href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
where he saw a ruined place and therein a deserted cell without a
door; and in it he took refuge and found shelter from the rain.
The tears streamed from his eyelids, and he fell to complaining of
what had betided him and saying, “Whither shall I flee from this
whore? I beseech Thee, O Lord, to vouchsafe me one who shall
conduct me to a far country, where she shall not know the way to
me!” Now while he sat weeping, behold, the wall clave and
there came forth to him therefrom one of tall stature, whose aspect
caused his body-pile to bristle and his flesh to creep, and said to
him, “O man, what aileth thee that thou disturbest me this night?
These two hundred years have I dwelt here and have never seen
any enter this place and do as thou dost. Tell me what thou
wishest and I will accomplish thy need, as ruth for thee hath got
hold upon my heart”. Quoth Ma’aruf, “Who and what art
thou?”; and quoth he, “I am the Haunter<a id='r17' href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> of this place.” So
Ma’aruf told him all that had befallen him with his wife and he
said, “Wilt thou have me convey thee to a country, where thy
wife shall know no way to thee?” “Yes,” said Ma’aruf; and the
other, “Then mount my back.” So he mounted on his back and
he flew with him from after supper-tide till daybreak, when he set
him down on the top of a high mountain——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Marid
having taken up Ma’aruf the Cobbler, flew off with him and set him
down upon a high mountain and said to him, “O mortal, descend
this mountain and thou wilt see the gate of a city. Enter it, for
therein thy wife cannot come at thee.” He then left him and went
his way, whilst Ma’aruf abode in amazement and perplexity till the
sun rose, when he said to himself, “I will up with me and go down
into the city: indeed there is no profit in my abiding upon this
highland.” So he descended to the mountain-foot and saw a city
girt by towering walls, full of lofty palaces and gold-adorned buildings
which was a delight to beholders. He entered in at the gate
and found it a place such as lightened the grieving heart; but, as
he walked through the streets the townsfolk stared at him as a
curiosity and gathered about him, marvelling at his dress, for it
was unlike theirs. Presently, one of them said to him, “O man,
art thou a stranger?” “Yes.” “What countryman art thou?”
“I am from the city of Cairo the Auspicious.” “And when didst
thou leave Cairo?” “I left it yesterday, at the hour of afternoon-prayer.”
Whereupon the man laughed at him and cried out,
saying, “Come look, O folk, at this man and hear what he saith!”
Quoth they, “What doeth he say?” and quoth the townsman,
“He pretendeth that he cometh from Cairo and left it yesterday
at the hour of afternoon-prayer!” At this they all laughed and
gathering round Ma’aruf, said to him, “O man, art thou mad to
talk thus? How canst thou pretend that thou leftest Cairo at
mid-afternoon yesterday and foundedst thyself this morning here,
when the truth is that between our city and Cairo lieth a full
year’s journey?” Quoth he, “None is mad but you. As for me,
I speak sooth, for here is bread which I brought with me from
Cairo, and see, ’tis yet new.” Then he showed them the bread
and they stared at it, for it was unlike their country bread. So
the crowd increased about him and they said to one another,
“This is Cairo bread: look at it;” and he became a gazing-stock
in the city and some believed him; whilst others gave him
the lie and made mock of him. Whilst this was going on, behold,
up came a merchant riding on a she-mule and followed by two
black slaves, and brake a way through the people, saying, “O
folk, are ye not ashamed to mob this stranger and make mock of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>him and scoff at him?” And he went on to rate them, till he
drave them away from Ma’aruf, and none could make him any
answer. Then he said to the stranger, “Come, O my brother,
no harm shall betide thee from these folk. Verily they have no
shame.”<a id='r18' href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> So he took him and carrying him to a spacious and
richly-adorned house, seated him in a speak-room fit for a King,
whilst he gave an order to his slaves, who opened a chest and
brought out to him a dress such as might be worn by a merchant
worth a thousand.<a id='r19' href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> He clad him therewith and Ma’aruf, being a
seemly man, became as he were consul of the merchants. Then
his host called for food and they set before them a tray of all
manner exquisite viands. The twain ate and drank and the
merchant said to Ma’aruf, “O my brother, what is thy name?”
“My name is Ma’aruf and I am a cobbler by trade and patch old
shoes.” “What countryman art thou?” “I am from Cairo.”
“What quarter?” “Dost thou know Cairo?” “I am of its
children.<a id='r20' href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a>” “I come from the Red Street.<a id='r21' href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a>” “And whom dost
thou know in the Red Street?” “I know such an one and such
an one,” answered Ma’aruf and named several people to him.
Quoth the other, “Knowest thou Shaykh Ahmad the druggist?<a id='r22' href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a>”
“He was my next neighbour, wall to wall.” “Is he well?”
“Yes.” “How many sons hath he?” “Three, Mustafà,
Mohammed and Ali.” “And what hath Allah done with
them?” “As for Mustafà, he is well and he is a learned man, a
professor<a id='r23' href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a>: Mohammed is a druggist and opened him a shop
beside that of his father, after he had married, and his wife hath
borne him a son named Hasan.” “Allah gladden thee with good
news!” said the merchant; and Ma’aruf continued, “As for
Ali, he was my friend, when we were boys, and we always
played together, I and he. We used to go in the guise of the
children of the Nazarenes and enter the church and steal the
books of the Christians and sell them and buy food with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>price. It chanced once that the Nazarenes caught us with a
book; whereupon they complained of us to our folk and said to
Ali’s father:—An thou hinder not thy son from troubling us, we
will complain of thee to the King. So he appeased them and
gave Ali a thrashing; wherefore he ran away none knew whither
and he hath now been absent twenty years and no man hath
brought news of him.” Quoth the host, “I am that very Ali, son
of Shaykh Ahmad the druggist, and thou art my playmate
Ma’aruf.”<a id='r24' href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> So they saluted each other and after the salam Ali
said, “Tell me why, O Ma’aruf, thou camest from Cairo to this
city.” Then he told him all that had befallen him of ill-doing
with his wife Fatimah the Dung and said, “So, when her annoy
waxed on me, I fled from her towards the Gate of Victory and
went forth the city. Presently, the rain fell heavy on me; so I
entered a ruined cell in the Adiliyah and sat there, weeping;
whereupon there came forth to me the Haunter of the place,
which was an Ifrit of the Jinn, and questioned me. I acquainted
him with my case and he took me on his back and flew with me
all night between heaven and earth, till he set me down on yonder
mountain and gave me to know of this city. So I came down
from the mountain and entered the city, when the people crowded
about me and questioned me. I told them that I had left Cairo
yesterday, but they believed me not, and presently thou camest up
and driving the folk away from me, carriedst me to this house. Such,
then, is the cause of my quitting Cairo; and thou, what object
brought thee hither?” Quoth Ali, “The giddiness<a id='r25' href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> of folly
turned my head when I was seven years old, from which time I
wandered from land to land and city to city, till I came to this
city, the name whereof is Ikhtiyán al-Khatan.<a id='r26' href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> I found its people
an hospitable folk and a kindly, compassionate for the poor man
and selling to him on credit and believing all he said. So quoth
I to them:—I am a merchant and have preceded my packs and I
need a place wherein to bestow my baggage. And they believed
me and assigned me a lodging. Then quoth I to them:—Is there
any of you will lend me a thousand dinars, till my loads arrive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>when I will repay it to him; for I am in want of certain things
before my goods come? They gave me what I asked and I went
to the merchants’ bazar, where, seeing goods, I bought them and
sold them next day at a profit of fifty gold pieces and bought
others.<a id='r27' href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> And I consorted with the folk and entreated them liberally,
so that they loved me, and I continued to sell and buy, till I grew
rich. Know, O my brother, that the proverb saith, The world is
show and trickery: and the land where none wotteth thee, there
do whatso liketh thee. Thou too, an thou say to all who ask
thee, I’m a cobbler by trade and poor withal, and I fled
from my wife and left Cairo yesterday, they will not believe thee
and thou wilt be a laughing-stock among them as long as thou
abidest in the city; whilst, an thou tell them, An Ifrit brought me
hither, they will take fright at thee and none will come near thee;
for they will say, This man is possessed of an Ifrit and harm will
betide whoso approacheth him. And such public report will be
dishonouring both to thee and to me, because they ken I come
from Cairo.” Ma’aruf asked:—“How then shall I do?”; and Ali
answered, “I will tell thee how thou shalt do, Inshallah! To-morrow
I will give thee a thousand dinars and a she-mule to ride
and a black slave, who shall walk before thee and guide thee to
the gate of the merchants’ bazar; and do thou go into them. I
will be there sitting amongst them, and when I see thee, I will
rise to thee and salute thee with the salam and kiss thy hand and
make a great man of thee. Whenever I ask thee of any kind of
stuff, saying, Hast thou brought with thee aught of such a kind?
do thou answer, “Plenty.<a id='r28' href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a>” And if they question me of thee, I
will praise thee and magnify thee in their eyes and say to them,
Get him a store-house and a shop. I also will give thee out for a
man of great wealth and generosity; and if a beggar come to thee,
bestow upon him what thou mayst; so will they put faith in what
I say and believe in thy greatness and generosity and love thee.
Then will I invite thee to my house and invite all the merchants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>on thy account and bring together thee and them, so that all may
know thee and thou know them,”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class='c000'>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
merchant Ali said to Ma’aruf, “I will invite thee to my house and
invite all the merchants on thy account and bring together thee and
them, so that all may know thee and thou know them, whereby
thou shalt sell and buy and take and give with them; nor will it
be long ere thou become a man of money.” Accordingly, on the
morrow he gave him a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a
black slave and mounting him on a she-mule, said to him, “Allah
give thee quittance of responsibility for all this,<a id='r29' href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> inasmuch as thou
art my friend and it behoveth me to deal generously with thee.
Have no care; but put away from thee the thought of thy wife’s
misways and name her not to any.” “Allah requite thee with
good!” replied Ma’aruf and rode on, preceded by his blackamoor
till the slave brought him to the gate of the merchants’ bazar,
where they were all seated, and amongst them Ali, who when he
saw him, rose and threw himself upon him, crying, “A blessed
day, O Merchant Ma’aruf, O man of good works and kindness<a id='r30' href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a>!”
And he kissed his hand before the merchants and said to them,
“Our brothers, ye are honoured by knowing<a id='r31' href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the merchant
Ma’aruf.” So they saluted him, and Ali signed to them to make
much of him, wherefore he was magnified in their eyes. Then Ali
helped him to dismount from his she-mule and saluted him with
the salam; after which he took the merchants apart, one after
other, and vaunted Ma’aruf to them. They asked, “Is this man a
merchant?;” and he answered, “Yes; and indeed he is the chiefest
of merchants, there liveth not a wealthier than he; for his wealth
and the riches of his father and forefathers are famous among the
merchants of Cairo. He hath partners in Hind and Sind and Al-Yaman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and is high in repute for generosity. So know ye his
rank and exalt ye his degree and do him service, and wot also
that his coming to your city is not for the sake of traffic, and none
other save to divert himself with the sight of folk’s countries: indeed,
he hath no need of strangerhood for the sake of gain and
profit, having wealth that fires cannot consume, and I am one of
his servants.” And he ceased not to extol him, till they set him
above their heads and began to tell one another of his qualities.
Then they gathered round him and offered him junkets<a id='r32' href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> and
sherbets, and even the Consul of the Merchants came to him and
saluted him; whilst Ali proceeded to ask him, in the presence of
the traders, “O my lord, haply thou hast brought with thee somewhat
of such and such a stuff?”; and Ma’aruf answered, “Plenty.”
Now Ali had that day shown him various kinds of costly clothes
and had taught him the names of the different stuffs, dear and
cheap. Then said one of the merchants, “O my lord, hast thou
brought with thee yellow broad cloth?”: and Ma’aruf said,
“Plenty”! Quoth another, “And gazelles’ blood red<a id='r33' href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a>?”; and
quoth the Cobbler, “Plenty”; and as often as he asked him of
aught, he made him the same answer. So the other said, “O
Merchant Ali had thy countryman a mind to transport a thousand
loads of costly stuffs, he could do so”; and Ali said, “He would
take them from a single one of his store-houses, and miss naught
thereof.” Now whilst they were sitting, behold, up came a beggar
and went the round of the merchants. One gave him a half dirham
and another a copper,<a id='r34' href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> but most of them gave him nothing, till he
came to Ma’aruf who pulled out a handful of gold and gave it to
him, whereupon he blessed him and went his ways. The merchants
marvelled at this and said, “Verily, this is a King’s bestowal for
he gave the beggar gold without count, and were he not a man
of vast wealth and money without end, he had not given a beggar
a handful of gold.” After a while, there came to him a poor
woman and he gave her a handful of gold; whereupon she went
away, blessing him, and told the other beggars, who came to him,
one after other, and he gave them each a handful of gold, till he
disbursed the thousand dinars. Then he struck hand upon hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and said, “Allah is our sufficient aid and excellent is the Agent!”
Quoth the Consul, “What aileth thee, O Merchant Ma’aruf?”; and
quoth he, “It seemeth that the most part of the people of this city are
poor and needy; had I known their misery I would have brought
with me a large sum of money in my saddle-bags and given
largesse thereof to the poor. I fear me I may be long abroad<a id='r35' href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
and ’tis not in my nature to baulk a beggar; and I have no gold
left: so, if a pauper come to me, what shall I say to him?”
Quoth the Consul, “Say, Allah will send thee thy daily bread<a id='r36' href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a>!”;
but Ma’aruf replied, “That is not my practice and I am care-ridden
because of this. Would I had other thousand dinars, wherewith
to give alms till my baggage come!” “Have no care for that,”
quoth the Consul and sending one of his dependents for a thousand
dinars, handed them to Ma’aruf, who went on giving them to
every beggar who passed till the call to noon-prayer. Then they
entered the Cathedral-mosque and prayed the noon-prayers, and
what was left him of the thousand gold pieces he scattered on
the heads of the worshippers. This drew the people’s attention to
him and they blessed him, whilst the merchants marvelled at the
abundance of his generosity and openhandedness. Then he turned
to another trader and borrowing of him other thousand ducats,
gave these also away, whilst Merchant Ali looked on at what he
did, but could not speak. He ceased not to do thus till the call
to mid-afternoon prayer, when he entered the mosque and prayed
and distributed the rest of the money. On this wise, by the time
they locked the doors of the bazar,<a id='r37' href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> he had borrowed five thousand
sequins and given them away, saying to every one of whom he
took aught, “Wait till my baggage come when, if thou desire gold
I will give thee gold, and if thou desire stuffs, thou shalt have
stuffs; for I have no end of them.” At eventide Merchant Ali
invited Ma’aruf and the rest of the traders to an entertainment
and seated him in the upper end, the place of honour, where he
talked of nothing but cloths and jewels, and whenever they made
mention to him of aught, he said, “I have plenty of it.” Next
day, he again repaired to the market-street where he showed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>friendly bias towards the merchants and borrowed of them more
money, which he distributed to the poor: nor did he leave doing
thus twenty days, till he had borrowed threescore thousand dinars,
and still there came no baggage, no, nor a burning plague.<a id='r38' href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
At last folk began to clamour for their money and say, “The
merchant Ma’aruf’s baggage cometh not. How long will he take
people’s monies and give them to the poor?” And quoth one of
them, “My rede is that we speak to Merchant Ali.” So they
went to him and said, “O Merchant Ali, Merchant Ma’aruf’s
baggage cometh not.” Said he, “Have patience, it cannot fail to
come soon.” Then he took Ma’aruf aside and said to him, “O
Ma’aruf, what fashion is this? Did I bid thee brown<a id='r39' href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> the bread
or burn it? The merchants clamour for their coin and tell me
that thou owest them sixty thousand dinars, which thou hast
borrowed and given away to the poor. How wilt thou satisfy the
folk, seeing that thou neither sellest nor buyest?” Said Ma’aruf,
“What matters it<a id='r40' href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a>; and what are threescore thousand dinars?
When my baggage shall come, I will pay them in stuffs or in gold
and silver, as they will.” Quoth Merchant Ali, “Allah is Most
Great! Hast thou then any baggage?” and he said, “Plenty.”
Cried the other, “Allah and the Hallows<a id='r41' href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> requite thee thine
impudence! Did I teach thee this saying, that thou shouldst
repeat it to me? But I will acquaint the folk with thee.”
Ma’aruf rejoined, “Begone and prate no more! Am I a poor
man? I have endless wealth in my baggage and as soon as it
cometh, they shall have their money’s worth, two for one. I have
no need of them.” At this Merchant Ali waxed wroth and said,
“Unmannerly wight that thou art, I will teach thee to lie to me
and be not ashamed!” Said Ma’aruf, “E’en work the worst thy
hand can do! They must wait till my baggage come, when they
shall have their due and more.” So Ali left him and went away,
saying in himself, “I praised him whilome and if I blame him
now, I make myself out a liar and become of those of whom it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>said:—Whoso praiseth and then blameth lieth twice.”<a id='r42' href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> And he
knew not what to do. Presently, the traders came to him and
said, “O Merchant Ali, hast thou spoken to him?” Said he, “O
folk, I am ashamed and, though he owe me a thousand dinars, I
cannot speak to him. When ye lent him your money ye consulted
me not; so ye have no claim on me. Dun him yourselves, and if
he pay you not, complain of him to the King of the city, saying:—He
is an impostor who hath imposed upon us. And he will
deliver you from the plague of him.” Accordingly, they repaired
to the King and told him what had passed, saying, “O King of
the age, we are perplexed anent this merchant, whose generosity
is excessive; for he doeth thus and thus, and all he borroweth, he
giveth away to the poor by handsful. Were he a man of naught,
his sense would not suffer him to lavish gold on this wise; and
were he a man of wealth, his good faith had been made manifest
to us by the coming of his baggage; but we see none of his
luggage, although he avoucheth that he hath a baggage-train and
hath preceded it. Now some time hath past, but there appeareth
no sign of his baggage-train, and he oweth us sixty thousand gold
pieces, all of which he hath given away in alms.” And they went
on to praise him and extol his generosity. Now this King was a
very covetous man, a more covetous than Ash’ab<a id='r43' href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a>; and when he
heard tell of Ma’aruf’s generosity and openhandedness, greed of
gain got the better of him and he said to his Wazir, “Were not
this merchant a man of immense wealth, he had not shown all
this munificence. His baggage-train will assuredly come, whereupon
these merchants will flock to him and he will scatter amongst
them riches galore. Now I have more right to this money than
they; wherefore I have a mind to make friends with him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>profess affection for him, so that, when his baggage cometh whatso
the merchants would have had I shall get of him; and I will give
him my daughter to wife and join his wealth to my wealth.”
Replied the Wazir, “O King of the age, methinks he is naught
but an impostor, and ’tis the impostor who ruineth the house of
the covetous;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Wazir said to the King, “Methinks he is naught but an
impostor, and ’tis the impostor who ruineth the house of the
covetous;” the King said, “O Wazir, I will prove him and soon
know if he be an impostor or a true man and whether he be a
rearling of Fortune or not.” The Wazir asked, “And how wilt
thou prove him?”; and the King answered, “I will send for him
to the presence and entreat him with honour and give him a jewel
which I have. An he know it and wot its price, he is a man of
worth and wealth; but an he know it not, he is an impostor and
an upstart and I will do him die by the foulest fashion of deaths.”
So he sent for Ma’aruf, who came and saluted him. The King
returned his salam and seating him beside himself, said to him,
“Art thou the merchant Ma’aruf?” and said he, “Yes.” Quoth
the King, “The merchants declare that thou owest them sixty
thousand ducats. Is this true?” “Yes,” quoth he. Asked the
King, “Then why dost thou not give them their money?”; and
he answered, “Let them wait till my baggage come and I will repay
them twofold. An they wish for gold, they shall have gold; and
should they wish for silver, they shall have silver; or an they
prefer for merchandise, I will give them merchandise; and to whom
I owe a thousand I will give two thousand in requital of that
wherewith he hath veiled my face before the poor; for I have
plenty.” Then said the King, “O merchant, take this and look
what is its kind and value.” And he gave him a jewel the bigness
of a hazel-nut, which he had bought for a thousand sequins and
not having its fellow, prized it highly. Ma’aruf took it and pressing
it between his thumb and forefinger brake it, for it was brittle
and would not brook the squeeze. Quoth the King, “Why hast
thou broken the jewel?”; and Ma’aruf laughed and said, “O King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of the age, this is no jewel. This is but a bittock of mineral worth
a thousand dinars; why dost thou style it a jewel? A jewel I call
such as is worth threescore and ten thousand gold pieces and this
is called but a piece of stone. A jewel that is not of the bigness
of a walnut hath no worth in my eyes and I take no account
thereof. How cometh it, then, that thou, who art King, stylest
this thing a jewel, when ’tis but a bit of mineral worth a thousand
dinars? But ye are excusable, for that ye are poor folk and have
not in your possession things of price.” The King asked, “O
merchant, hast thou jewels such as those whereof thou speakest?”;
and he answered, “Plenty.” Whereupon avarice overcame the
King and he said, “Wilt thou give me real jewels?” Said
Ma’aruf, “When my baggage-train shall come, I will give thee no
end of jewels; and all that thou canst desire I have in plenty and
will give thee, without price.” At this the King rejoiced and said
to the traders, “Wend your ways and have patience with him, till
his baggage arrive, when do ye come to me and receive your
monies from me.” So they fared forth and the King turned to his
Wazir and said to him, “Pay court to Merchant Ma’aruf and take
and give with him in talk and bespeak him of my daughter,
Princess Dunyá, that he may wed her and so we gain these riches
he hath.” Said the Wazir, “O King of the age, this man’s
fashion misliketh me and methinks he is an impostor and a liar:
so leave this whereof thou speakest lest thou lose thy daughter for
naught.” Now this Minister had sued the King aforetime to give
him his daughter to wife and he was willing to do so, but when she
heard of it she consented not to marry him. Accordingly, the
King said to him, “O traitor, thou desirest no good for me, because
in past time thou soughtest my daughter in wedlock, but she would
none of thee; so now thou wouldst cut off the way of her marriage
and wouldst have the Princess lie fallow, that thou mayst take her;
but hear from me one word. Thou hast no concern in this matter.
How can he be an impostor and a liar, seeing that he knew the
price of the jewel, even that for which I bought it, and brake it
because it pleased him not? He hath jewels in plenty, and when
he goeth in to my daughter and seeth her to be beautiful, she will
captivate his reason and he will love her and give her jewels and
things of price: but, as for thee, thou wouldst forbid my daughter
and myself these good things.” So the Minister was silent, for
fear of the King’s anger, and said to himself, “Set the curs on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>cattle<a id='r44' href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a>!” Then with show of friendly bias he betook himself to
Ma’aruf and said to him, “His highness the King loveth thee and
hath a daughter, a winsome lady and a lovesome, to whom he is
minded to marry thee. What sayst thou?” Said he, “No harm
in that; but let him wait till my baggage come, for marriage-settlements
on Kings’ daughters are large and their rank demandeth
that they be not endowed save with a dowry befitting
their degree. At this present I have no money with me till the
coming of my baggage, for I have wealth in plenty and needs
must I make her marriage-portion five thousand purses. Then I
shall need a thousand purses to distribute amongst the poor and
needy on my wedding-night, and other thousand to give to those
who walk in the bridal procession and yet other thousand wherewith
to provide provaunt for the troops and others<a id='r45' href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a>; and I shall
want an hundred jewels to give to the Princess on the wedding-morning<a id='r46' href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
and other hundred gems to distribute among the slave-girls
and eunuchs, for I must give each of them a jewel in honour
of the bride; and I need wherewithal to clothe a thousand naked
paupers, and alms too needs must be given. All this cannot be
done till my baggage come; but I have plenty and, once it is
here, I shall make no account of all this outlay.” The Wazir
returned to the King and told him what Ma’aruf said, whereupon
quoth he, “Since this is his wish, how canst thou style him impostor
and liar?” Replied the Minister, “And I cease not to say
this.” But the King chid him angrily and threatened him, saying,
“By the life of my head, an thou cease not this talk, I will slay
thee! Go back to him and fetch him to me and I will manage
matters with him myself.” So the Wazir returned to Ma’aruf
and said to him, “Come and speak with the King.” “I hear and
I obey,” said Ma’aruf and went in to the King, who said to him,
“Thou shalt not put me off with these excuses, for my treasury is
full; so take the keys and spend all thou needest and give what
thou wilt and clothe the poor and do thy desire and have no care
for the girl and the handmaids. When the baggage shall come,
do what thou wilt with thy wife, by way of generosity, and we will
have patience with thee anent the marriage-portion till then, for
there is no manner of difference betwixt me and thee; none at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>all.” Then he sent for the Shaykh Al-Islam<a id='r47' href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and bade him write
out the marriage-contract between his daughter and Merchant
Ma’aruf, and he did so; after which the King gave the signal
for beginning the wedding festivities and bade decorate the city.
The kettle drums beat and the tables were spread with meats of
all kinds and there came performers who paraded their tricks.
Merchant Ma’aruf sat upon a throne in a parlour and the players
and gymnasts and effeminates<a id='r48' href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and dancing-men of wondrous
movements and posture-makers of marvellous cunning came before
him, whilst he called out to the treasurer and said to him, “Bring
gold and silver.” So he brought gold and silver and Ma’aruf went
round among the spectators and largessed each performer by the
handful; and he gave alms to the poor and needy and clothes
to the naked and it was a clamorous festival and a right merry.
The treasurer could not bring money fast enough from the treasury,
and the Wazir’s heart was like to burst for rage; but he dared
not say a word, whilst Merchant Ali marvelled at this waste
of wealth and said to Merchant Ma’aruf, “Allah and the
Hallows visit this upon thy head-sides<a id='r49' href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a>! Doth it not suffice
thee to squander the traders’ money, but thou must squander
that of the King to boot?” Replied Ma’aruf, “’Tis none of
thy concern: whenas my baggage shall come, I will requite the
King manifold.” And he went on lavishing money and saying
in himself, “A burning plague! What will happen will happen
and there is no flying from that which is fore-ordained.” The
festivities ceased not for the space of forty days, and on the one-and-fortieth
day, they made the bride’s cortège and all the Emirs
and troops walked before her. When they brought her in before
Ma’aruf, he began scattering gold on the people’s heads, and they
made her a mighty fine procession, whilst Ma’aruf expended in
her honour vast sums of money. Then they brought him in to
Princess Dunya and he sat down on the high divan; after which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>they let fall the curtains and shut the doors and withdrew, leaving
him alone with his bride; whereupon he smote hand upon
hand and sat awhile sorrowful and saying, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great!” Quoth the Princess, “O my lord, Allah preserve thee!
What aileth thee that thou art troubled?” Quoth he, “And how
should I be other than troubled, seeing that thy father hath
embarrassed me and done with me a deed which is like the burning
of green corn?” She asked, “And what hath my father done
with thee? Tell me!”; and he answered, “He hath brought me in
to thee before the coming of my baggage, and I want at very least
an hundred jewels to distribute among thy handmaids, to each a
jewel, so she might rejoice therein and say, My lord gave me a
jewel on the night of his going in to my lady. This good deed
would I have done in honour of thy station and for the increase of
thy dignity; and I have no need to stint myself in lavishing jewels,
for I have of them great plenty.” Rejoined she, “Be not concerned
for that. As for me, trouble not thyself about me, for I will have
patience with thee till thy baggage shall come, and as for my
women have no care for them. Rise, doff thy clothes and take
thy pleasure; and when the baggage cometh we shall get the
jewels and the rest.” So he arose and putting off his clothes sat
down on the bed and sought love-liesse and they fell to toying
with each other. He laid his hand on her knee and she sat down
in his lap and thrust her lip like a tit-bit of meat into his mouth,
and that hour was such as maketh a man to forget his father and
his mother. So he clasped her in his arms and strained her fast
to his breast and sucked her lip, till the honey-dew ran out into
his mouth; and he laid his hand under her left-armpit, whereupon
his vitals and her vitals yearned for coition. Then he clapped her
between the breasts and his hand slipped down between her thighs
and she girded him with her legs, whereupon he made of the two
parts proof amain and crying out, “O sire of the chin-veils twain<a id='r50' href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a><a id='t20'></a>!”
applied the priming and kindled the match and set it to the touch-hole
and gave fire and breached the citadel in its four corners; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>there befel the mystery<a id='r51' href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a> concerning which there is no enquiry;
and she cried the cry that needs must be cried.<a id='r52' href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while
the Princess Dunya cried the cry which must be cried, Merchant
Ma’aruf abated her maidenhead and that night was one not to be
counted among lives for that which it comprised of the enjoyment
of the fair, clipping and dallying <i><span lang="fr">langue fourrée</span></i> and futtering till
the dawn of day, when he arose and entered the Hammam whence,
after donning a suit for sovrans suitable he betook himself to the
King’s Divan. All who were there rose to him and received him
with honour and worship, giving him joy and invoking blessings
upon him; and he sat down by the King’s side and asked, “Where
is the treasurer?” They answered, “Here he is, before thee,”
and he said to him, “Bring robes of honour for all the Wazirs and
Emirs and dignitaries and clothe them therewith.” The treasurer
brought him all he sought and he sat giving to all who came to
him and lavishing largesse upon every man according to his
station. On this wise he abode twenty days, whilst no baggage
appeared for him nor aught else, till the treasurer was straitened
by him to the uttermost and going in to the King, as he sat alone
with the Wazir in Ma’aruf’s absence, kissed ground between his
hands and said, “O King of the age, I must tell thee somewhat,
lest haply thou blame me for not acquainting thee therewith.
Know that the treasury is being exhausted; there is none but a
little money left in it and in ten days more we shall shut it upon
emptiness.” Quoth the King, “O Wazir, verily my son-in-law’s
baggage-train tarrieth long and there appeareth no news thereof.”
The Minister laughed and said, “Allah be gracious to thee, O
King of the age! Thou art none other but heedless with respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to this impostor, this liar. As thy head liveth, there is no baggage
for him, no, nor a burning plague to rid us of him! Nay, he hath
but imposed on thee without surcease, so that he hath wasted
thy treasures and married thy daughter for naught. How long
therefore wilt thou be heedless of this liar?” Then quoth the
King, “O Wazir, how shall we do to learn the truth of his case?”;
and quoth the Wazir, “O King of the age, none may come at a
man’s secret but his wife; so send for thy daughter and let her
come behind the curtain, that I may question her of the truth of
his estate, to the intent that she may make question of him and
acquaint us with his case.” Cried the King, “There is no harm in
that; and as my head liveth, if it be proved that he is a liar and
an impostor, I will verily do him die by the foulest of deaths!”
Then he carried the Wazir into the sitting-chamber and sent for
his daughter, who came behind the curtain, her husband being
absent, and said, “What wouldst thou, O my father?” Said he
“Speak with the Wazir.” So she asked, “Ho thou, the Wazir,
what is thy will?”; and he answered, “O my lady, thou must
know that thy husband hath squandered thy father’s substance
and married thee without a dower; and he ceaseth not to promise
us and break his promises, nor cometh there any tidings of his
baggage; in short we would have thee inform us concerning him.”
Quoth she, “Indeed his words be many, and he still cometh and
promiseth me jewels and treasures and costly stuffs; but I see
nothing.” Quoth the Wazir, “O my lady, canst thou this night
take and give with him in talk and whisper to him:—Say me sooth
and fear from me naught, for thou art become my husband and I
will not transgress against thee. So tell me the truth of the matter
and I will devise thee a device whereby thou shalt be set at rest.
And do thou play near and far<a id='r53' href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> with him in words and profess love
to him and win him to confess and after tell us the facts of his case.”
And she answered, “O my papa, I know how I will make proof
of him.” Then she went away and after supper her husband came
in to her, according to his wont, whereupon Princess Dunya
rose to him and took him under the armpit and wheedled
him with winsomest wheedling (and all-sufficient<a id='r54' href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> are woman’s
wiles whenas she would aught of men); and she ceased not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to caress him and beguile him with speech sweeter than the
honey till she stole his reason; and when she saw that he altogether
inclined to her, she said to him, “O my beloved, O coolth
of my eyes and fruit of my vitals, Allah never desolate me by less
of thee nor Time sunder us twain me and thee! Indeed, the love
of thee hath homed in my heart and the fire of passion hath consumed
my liver, nor will I ever forsake thee or transgress against
thee. But I would have thee tell me the truth, for that the
sleights of falsehood profit not, nor do they secure credit at all
seasons. How long wilt thou impose upon my father and lie to
him? I fear lest thine affair be discovered to him, ere we can
devise some device and he lay violent hands upon thee? So
acquaint me with the facts of the case for naught shall befal thee
save that which shall begladden thee; and, when thou shalt have
spoken sooth, fear not harm shall betide thee. How often wilt
thou declare that thou art a merchant and a man of money and
hast a luggage-train? This long while past thou sayest, My
baggage! my baggage! but there appeareth no sign of thy
baggage, and visible in thy face is anxiety on this account. So
an there be no worth in thy words, tell me and I will contrive
thee a contrivance whereby thou shalt come off safe, Inshallah!”
He replied, “I will tell thee the truth, and then do thou whatso
thou wilt.” Rejoined she, “Speak and look thou speak soothly; for
sooth is the ark of safety, and beware of lying, for it dishonoureth
the liar and God-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>He said, “Know, then, O my lady, that I am no merchant and
have no baggage, no, nor a burning plague; nay, I was but a
cobbler in my own country and had a wife called Fatimah the
Dung, with whom there befel me this and that.” And he told
her his story from beginning to end; whereat she laughed and
said, “Verily, thou art clever in the practice of lying and imposture!”
Whereto he answered, “O my lady, may Allah
Almighty preserve thee to veil sins and countervail chagrins!”
Rejoined she, “Know, that thou imposedst upon my sire and
deceivedst him by dint of thy deluding vaunts, so that of his
greed for gain he married me to thee. Then thou squanderedst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>his wealth and the Wazir beareth thee a grudge for this. How
many a time hath he spoken against thee to my father, saying,
Indeed, he is an impostor, a liar! But my sire hearkened not to
his say, for that he had sought me in wedlock and I consented not
that he be baron and I femme. However, the time grew longsome
upon my sire and he became straitened and said to me,
Make him confess. So I have made thee confess and that which
was covered is discovered. Now my father purposeth thee a mischief
because of this; but thou art become my husband and I will never
transgress against thee. An I told my father what I have learnt
from thee, he would be certified of thy falsehood and imposture and
that thou imposest upon Kings’ daughters and squanderest royal
wealth: so would thine offence find with him no pardon and he
would slay thee sans a doubt: wherefore it would be bruited
among the folk that I married a man who was a liar, an impostor,
and this would smirch mine honour. Furthermore an he kill
thee, most like he will require me to wed another, and to such
thing I will never consent; no, not though I die!<a id='r55' href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> So rise
now and don a Mameluke’s dress and take these fifty thousand
dinars of my monies, and mount a swift steed and get thee to a
land whither the rule of my father doth not reach. Then make
thee a merchant and send me a letter by a courier who shall
bring it privily to me, that I may know in what land thou art, so
I may send thee all my hand can attain. Thus shall thy wealth
wax great and if my father die, I will send for thee, and thou
shalt return in respect and honour; and if we die, thou or I and
go to the mercy of God the Most Great, the Resurrection shall
unite us. This, then, is the rede that is right: and while we both
abide alive and well, I will not cease to send thee letters and
monies. Arise ere the day wax bright and thou be in perplexed
plight and perdition upon thy head alight!” Quoth he, “O my
lady, I beseech thee of thy favour to bid me farewell with thine
embracement;” and quoth she, “No harm in that.”<a id='r56' href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> So he
embraced her and knew her carnally; after which he made the
Ghusl-ablution; then, donning the dress of a white slave, he bade
the syces saddle him a thoroughbred steed. Accordingly, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>saddled him a courser and he mounted and farewelling his wife,
rode forth the city at the last of the night, whilst all who saw him
deemed him one of the Mamelukes of the Sultan going abroad on
some business. Next morning, the King and his Wazir repaired
to the sitting-chamber and sent for Princess Dunya who came
behind the curtain; and her father said to her, “O my daughter,
what sayst thou?” Said she, “I say, Allah blacken thy Wazir’s
face, because he would have blackened my face in my husband’s
eyes!” Asked the King, “How so?”; and she answered, “He
came in to me yesterday; but, before I could name the matter to
him, behold, in walked Faraj the Chief Eunuch, letter in hand,
and said:—Ten white slaves stand under the palace window and
have given me this letter, saying:—Kiss for us the hands of our
lord, Merchant Ma’aruf, and give him this letter, for we are of his
Mamelukes with the baggage, and it hath reached us that he hath
wedded the King’s daughter, so we are come to acquaint him with
that which befel us by the way. Accordingly I took the letter
and read as follows:—From the five hundred Mamelukes to his
highness our lord Merchant Ma’aruf. But further. We give thee
to know that, after thou quittedst us, the Arabs<a id='r57' href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> came out upon us
and attacked us. They were two thousand horse and we five
hundred mounted slaves and there befel a mighty sore fight
between us and them. They hindered us from the road thirty days
doing battle with them and this is the cause of our tarrying from
thee.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class='ph3'>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess
Dunya said to her sire, “My husband received a letter from his
dependents ending with:—The Arabs hindered us from the road
thirty days which is the cause of our being behind time. They
also took from us of the luggage two hundred loads of cloth and
slew of us fifty Mamelukes. When the news reached my husband,
he cried, Allah disappoint them! What ailed them to wage war
with the Arabs for the sake of two hundred loads of merchandise?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>What are two hundred loads? It behoved them not to tarry on
that account, for verily the value of the two hundred loads is only
some seven thousand dinars. But needs must I go to them and
hasten them. As for that which the Arabs have taken, ’twill not
be missed from the baggage, nor doth it weigh with me a whit, for
I reckon it as if I had given it to them by way of an alms. Then
he went down from me, laughing and taking no concern for the
wastage of his wealth nor the slaughter of his slaves. As soon as
he was gone, I looked out from the lattice and saw the ten Mamelukes
who had brought him the letter, as they were moons, each
clad in a suit of clothes worth two thousand dinars, there is not
with my father a chattel to match one of them. He went forth
with them to bring up his baggage and hallowed be Allah who
hindered me from saying to him aught of that thou badest me, for
he would have made mock of me and thee, and haply he would
have eyed me with the eye of disparagement and hated me. But
the fault is all with thy Wazir,<a id='r58' href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> who speaketh against my husband
words that besit him not.” Replied the King, “O my daughter,
thy husband’s wealth is indeed endless and he recketh not of it;
for, from the day he entered our city, he hath done naught but
give alms to the poor. Inshallah, he will speedily return with the
baggage, and good in plenty shall betide us from him.” And he
went on to appease her and menace the Wazir, being duped by
her device. So fared it with the King; but as regards Merchant
Ma’aruf he rode on into waste lands, perplexed and knowing not
to what quarter he should betake him; and for the anguish of
parting he lamented and in the pangs of passion and love-longing
he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time falsed our Union and divided who were one in tway; ✿ And the sore tyranny of Time doth melt my heart away:</div>

      <div class='line'>O favour like the full moon’s face of sheen, indeed I’m he ✿ Whom thou didst leave with vitals torn when faring on thy way.</div>
      <div class='line'>Would I had never seen thy sight, or met thee for an hour; ✿ Since after sweetest taste of thee to bitters I’m a prey.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Ma’aruf will never cease to be enthralled by Dunyá’s<a id='r59' href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> charms ✿ And long live she albe he die whom love and longing slay,</div>
      <div class='line'>O brilliance, like resplendent sun of noontide, deign them heal ✿ His heart for kindness<a id='r60' href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and the fire of longing love allay!</div>

      <div class='line'>I’m well content with passion-pine and all its bane and bate ✿ For luck in love is evermore the butt of jealous Fate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And when he ended his verses, he wept with sore weeping, for
indeed the ways were walled up before his face and death seemed
to him better than dreeing life, and he walked on like a drunken
man for stress of distraction, and stayed not till noontide, when he
came to a little town and saw a plougher hard by, ploughing with
a yoke of bulls. Now hunger was sore upon him; and he went
up to the ploughman and said to him, “Peace be with thee!”;
and he returned his salam and said to him, “Welcome, O my lord!
Art thou one of the Sultan’s Mamelukes?” Quoth Ma’aruf,
“Yes;” and the other said, “Alight with me for a guest-meal.”
Whereupon Ma’aruf knew him to be of the liberal and said to him,
“O my brother, I see with thee naught with which thou mayst
feed me: how is it, then, that thou invitest me?” Answered the
husbandman, “O my lord, weal is well nigh.<a id='r62' href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Dismount thee
here: the town is near hand and I will go and fetch thee dinner
and fodder for thy stallion.” Rejoined Ma’aruf, “Since the town
is near at hand, I can go thither as quickly as thou canst and buy
me what I have a mind to in the bazar and eat.” The peasant
replied, “O my lord, the place is but a little village<a id='r63' href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and there is
no bazar there, neither selling nor buying. So I conjure thee by
Allah, alight here with me and hearten my heart, and I will run
thither and return to thee in haste.” Accordingly he dismounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and the Fellah left him and went off to the village, to fetch dinner
for him whilst Ma’aruf sat awaiting him. Presently he said in
himself, “I have taken this poor man away from his work; but I
will arise and plough in his stead, till he come back, to make up
for having hindered him from his work.<a id='r64' href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a>” Then he took the
plough and starting the bulls, ploughed a little, till the share
struck against something and the beasts stopped. He goaded them
on, but they could not move the plough; so he looked at the share
and finding it caught in a ring of gold, cleared away the soil and
saw that it was set centre-most a slab of alabaster, the size of the
nether millstone. He strave at the stone till he pulled it from its
place, when there appeared beneath it a souterrain with a stair.
Presently he descended the flight of steps and came to a place
like a Hammam, with four<a id='t28'></a> daïses, the first full of gold, from floor to
roof, the second full of emeralds and pearls and coral also from
ground to ceiling; the third of jacinths and rubies and turquoises
and the fourth of diamonds and all manner other preciousest
stones. At the upper end of the place stood a coffer of clearest
crystal, full of union-gems each the size of a walnut, and upon the
coffer lay a casket of gold, the bigness of a lemon. When he saw
this, he marvelled and rejoiced with joy exceeding and said to
himself, “I wonder what is in this casket?” So he opened it and
found therein a seal-ring of gold, whereon were graven names and
talismans, as they were the tracks of creeping ants. He rubbed
the ring and behold, a voice said, “Adsum! Here am I, at thy
service, O my lord! Ask and it shall be given unto thee. Wilt
thou raise a city or ruin a capital or kill a king or dig a river-channel
or aught of the kind? Whatso thou seekest, it shall
come to pass, by leave of the King of All-might, Creator of day
and night.” Ma’aruf asked, “O creature of my lord, who and
what art thou?”; and the other answered, “I am the slave of
this seal-ring standing in the service of him who possesseth it.
Whatsoever he seeketh, that I accomplish for him, and I have no
excuse in neglecting that he biddeth me do; because I am Sultan
over two-and-seventy tribes of the Jinn, each two-and-seventy
thousand in number every one of which thousand ruleth over a
thousand Marids, each Marid over a thousand Ifrits, each Ifrit
over a thousand Satans and each Satan over a thousand Jinn: and
they are all under command of me and may not gainsay me. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>for me, I am spelled to this seal-ring and may not thwart whoso
holdeth it. Lo! thou hast gotten hold of it and I am become thy
slave; so ask what thou wilt, for I hearken to thy word and
obey thy bidding; and if thou have need of me at any time, by
land or by sea rub the signet-ring and thou wilt find me with thee.
But beware of rubbing it twice in succession, or thou wilt consume
me with the fire of the names graven thereon; and thus
wouldst thou lose me and after regret me. Now I have acquainted
thee with my case and—the Peace!”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Slave of the Signet-ring acquainted Ma’aruf with his case,
the Merchant asked him, “What is thy name?” and the Jinni
answered, “My name is Abú al-Sa’ádát.<a id='r65' href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a>” Quoth Ma’aruf, “O
Abu al-Sa’adat what is this place and who enchanted thee in this
casket?”; and quoth he, “O my lord, this is a treasure called the
Hoard of Shaddád son of Ad, him who the base of ‘Many-columned
Iram laid, the like of which in the lands was never
made.<a id='r66' href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a>’ I was his slave in his lifetime and this is his Seal-ring,
which he laid up in his treasure; but it hath fallen to thy lot.”
Ma’aruf enquired, “Canst thou transport that which is in this
hoard to the surface of the earth?”; and the Jinni replied, “Yes!
Nothing were easier.” Said Ma’aruf, “Bring it forth and leave
naught.” So the Jinni signed with his hand to the ground, which
clave asunder, and he sank and was absent a little while. Presently,
there came forth young boys full of grace, and fair of face bearing
golden baskets filled with gold which they emptied out and going
away, returned with more; nor did they cease to transport the
gold and jewels, till ere an hour had sped they said, “Naught is
left in the hoard.” Thereupon out came Abu al-Sa’adat and said
to Ma’aruf, “O my lord, thou seest that we have brought forth all
that was in the hoard.” Ma’aruf asked, “Who be these beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>boys?” and the Jinni answered, “They are my sons. This
matter merited not that I should muster for it the Marids, wherefore
my sons have done thy desire and are honoured by such
service. So ask what thou wilt beside this.” Quoth Ma’aruf,
“Canst thou bring me he-mules and chests and fill the chests with
the treasure and load them on the mules?” Quoth Abu al-Sa’adat,
“Nothing easier,” and cried a great cry; whereupon his
sons presented themselves before him, to the number of eight
hundred, and he said to them, “Let some of you take the semblance
of he-mules and others of muleteers and handsome Mamelukes, the
like of the least of whom is not found with any of the Kings; and
others of you be transmewed to muleteers, and the rest to menials.”
So seven hundred of them changed themselves into bât-mules and
other hundred took the shape of slaves. Then Abu al-Sa’adat
called upon his Marids, who presented themselves between his
hands and he commanded some of them to assume the aspect of
horses saddled with saddles of gold crusted with jewels. And
when Ma’aruf saw them do as he bade he cried, “Where be the
chests?” They brought them before him and he said, “Pack the
gold and the stones, each sort by itself.” So they packed them
and loaded three hundred he-mules with them. Then asked
Ma’aruf, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, canst thou bring me some loads of
costly stuffs?”; and the Jinni answered, “Wilt thou have Egyptian
stuffs or Syrian or Persian or Indian or Greek?” Ma’aruf said,
“Bring me an hundred loads of each kind, on five hundred mules;”
and Abu al-Sa’adat, “O my lord accord me delay that I may
dispose my Marids for this and send a company of them to each
country to fetch an hundred loads of its stuffs and then take the
form of he-mules and return, carrying the stuffs.” Ma’aruf
enquired, “What time dost thou want?”; and Abu al-Sa’adat
replied, “The time of the blackness of the night, and day shall not
dawn ere thou have all thou desirest.” Said Ma’aruf, “I grant
thee this time,” and bade them pitch him a pavilion. So they
pitched it and he sat down therein and they brought him a table
of food. Then said Abu al-Sa’adat to him, “O my lord, tarry
thou in this tent and these my sons shall guard thee: so fear
thou nothing; for I go to muster my Marids and despatch them
to do thy desire.” So saying, he departed, leaving Ma’aruf
seated in the pavilion, with the table before him and the Jinni’s
sons attending upon him, in the guise of slaves and servants and
suite. And while he sat in this state behold, up came the husbandman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>with a great porringer of lentils<a id='r67' href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> and a nose-bag full of
barley and seeing the pavilion pitched and the Mamelukes standing,
hands upon breasts, thought that the Sultan was come and had
halted on that stead. So he stood open-mouthed and said in
himself, “Would I had killed a couple of chickens and fried them
red with clarified cow-butter for the Sultan!” And he would
have turned back to kill the chickens as a regale for the Sultan;
but Ma’aruf saw him and cried out to him and said to the
Mamelukes, “Bring him hither.” So they brought him and his
porringer of lentils before Ma’aruf, who said to him, “What is
this?” Said the peasant, “This is thy dinner and thy horse’s
fodder! Excuse me, for I thought not that the Sultan would
come hither; and, had I known that, I would have killed a
couple of chickens and entertained him in goodly guise.” Quoth
Ma’aruf, “The Sultan is not come. I am his son-in-law and I
was vexed with him. However he hath sent his officers to
make his peace with me, and now I am minded to return to
city. But thou hast made me this guest-meal without knowing
me, and I accept it from thee, lentils though it be, and will not
eat save of thy cheer.” Accordingly he bade him set the porringer
amiddlemost the table and ate of it his sufficiency, whilst the
Fellah filled his belly with those rich meats. Then Ma’aruf washed
his hands and gave the Mamelukes leave to eat; so they fell upon
the remains of the meal and ate; and, when the porringer was
empty, he filled it with gold and gave it to the peasant, saying,
“Carry this to thy dwelling and come to me in the city, and I
will entreat thee with honour.” Thereupon the peasant took the
porringer full of gold and returned to the village, driving the bulls
before him and deeming himself akin to the King. Meanwhile,
they brought Ma’aruf girls of the Brides of the Treasure,<a id='r68' href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> who
smote on instruments of music and danced before him, and he
passed that night in joyance and delight, a night not to be
reckoned among lives. Hardly had dawned the day when there
arose a great cloud of dust which presently lifting, discovered
seven hundred mules laden with stuffs and attended by muleteers
and baggage-tenders and cresset-bearers. With them came Abu
al-Sa’adat, riding on a she-mule, in the guise of a caravan-leader,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and before him was a travelling-litter, with four corner-terminals<a id='r69' href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
of glittering red gold, set with gems. When Abu al-Sa’adat came
up to the tent, he dismounted and kissing the earth, said to Ma’aruf,
“O my lord, thy desire hath been done to the uttermost and in
the litter is a treasure-suit which hath not its match among Kings’
raiment: so don it and mount the litter and bid us do what thou
wilt.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, I wish thee to go to
the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khutan and present thyself to my father-in-law
the King; and go thou not in to him but in the guise of a
mortal courier;” and quoth he, “To hear is to obey.” So Ma’aruf
wrote a letter to the Sultan and sealed it and Abu al-Sa’adat took
it and set out with it; and when he arrived, he found the King
saying, “O Wazir, indeed my heart is concerned for my son-in-law
and I fear lest the Arabs slay him. Would Heaven I wot
whither he was bound, that I might have followed him with the
troops! Would he had told me his destination!” Said the
Wazir, “Allah be merciful to thee for this thy heedlessness! As
thy head liveth, the wight saw that we were awake to him and
feared dishonour and fled, for he is nothing but an impostor, a
liar.” And behold, at this moment in came the courier and
kissing ground before the King, wished him permanent glory and
prosperity and length of life. Asked the King, “Who art thou
and what is thy business?” “I am a courier,” answered the Jinni,
“and thy son-in-law who is come with the baggage sendeth me to
thee with a letter, and here it is!” So he took the letter and read
therein these words, “After salutations galore to our uncle<a id='r70' href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> the
glorious King! Know that I am at hand with the baggage-train:
so come thou forth to meet me with the troops.” Cried the King,
“Allah blacken thy brow, O Wazir! How often wilt thou defame
my son-in-law’s name and call him liar and impostor? Behold,
he is come with the baggage-train and thou art naught but a
traitor.” The Minister hung his head groundwards in shame and
confusion and replied, “O King of the age, I said not this save
because of the long delay of the baggage and because I feared the
loss of the wealth he hath wasted.” The King exclaimed, “O
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>traitor, what are my riches! Now that his baggage is come he
will give me great plenty in their stead.” Then he bade decorate
the city and going in to his daughter, said to her, “Good news for
thee! Thy husband will be here anon with his baggage; for he
hath sent me a letter to that effect and here am I now going forth
to meet him.” The Princess Dunya marvelled at this and said in
herself, “This is a wondrous thing! Was he laughing at me and
making mock of me, or had he a mind to try me, when he told me
that he was a pauper? But Alhamdolillah, Glory to God, for that
I failed not of my duty to him!” On this wise fared it in the
Palace; but as regards Merchant Ali, the Cairene, when he saw
the decoration of the city and asked the cause thereof, they said
to him, “The baggage-train of Merchant Ma’aruf, the King’s son-in-law,
is come.” Said he, “Allah is Almighty! What a calamity
is this man!<a id='r71' href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> He came to me, fleeing from his wife, and he was
a poor man. Whence then should he get a baggage-train? But
haply this is a device which the King’s daughter hath contrived
for him, fearing his disgrace, and Kings are not unable to do anything.
May Allah the Most High veil his fame and not bring
him to public shame!”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Merchant Ali asked the cause of the decorations, they told him
the truth of the case; so he blessed Merchant Ma’aruf and cried,
“May Allah Almighty veil his fame and not bring him to public
shame!” And all the merchants rejoiced and were glad for that
they would get their monies. Then the King assembled his
troops and rode forth, whilst Abu al-Sa’adat returned to Ma’aruf
and acquainted him with the delivering of the letter. Quoth
Ma’aruf, “Bind on the loads;” and when they had done so, he
donned the treasure-suit and mounting the litter became a
thousand times greater and more majestic than the King. Then
he set forward; but, when he had gone half-way, behold, the
King met him with the troops, and seeing him riding in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Takhtrawan and clad in the dress aforesaid, threw himself upon
him and saluted him, and giving him joy of his safety, greeted
him with the greeting of peace. Then all the Lords of the land
saluted him and it was made manifest that he had spoken the
truth and that in him there was no lie. Presently he entered the
city in such state procession as would have caused the gall-bladder
of the lion to burst<a id='r72' href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a> for envy and the traders pressed up to him
and kissed his hands, whilst Merchant Ali said to him, “Thou hast
played off this trick and it hath prospered to thy hand, O Shaykh
of Impostors! But thou deservest it and may Allah the Most
High increase thee of His bounty!”; whereupon Ma’aruf laughed.
Then he entered the palace and sitting down on the throne said,
“Carry the loads of gold into the treasury of my uncle the King
and bring me the bales of cloth.” So they brought them to him
and opened them before him, bale after bale, till they had unpacked
the seven hundred loads, whereof he chose out the best and said,
“Bear these to Princess Dunya that she may distribute them
among her slave-girls; and carry her also this coffer of jewels,
that she may divide them among her handmaids and eunuchs.”
Then he proceeded to make over to the merchants in whose debt
he was stuffs by way of payment for their arrears, giving him
whose due was a thousand, stuffs worth two thousand or more;
after which he fell to distributing to the poor and needy, whilst
the King looked on with greedy eyes and could not hinder him;
nor did he cease largesse till he had made an end of the seven
hundred loads, when he turned to the troops and proceeded to
apportion amongst them emeralds and rubies and pearls and coral
and other jewels by handsful, without count, till the King said to
him, “Enough of this giving, O my son! There is but little left
of the baggage.” But he said, “I have plenty.” Then indeed,
his good faith was become manifest and none could give him the
lie; and he had come to reck not of giving, for that the Slave of
the Seal-ring brought him whatsoever he sought. Presently, the
treasurer came in to the King and said, “O King of the age, the
treasury is full indeed and will not hold the rest of the loads.
Where shall we lay that which is left of the gold and jewels?”
And he assigned to him another place. As for the Princess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Dunya when she saw this, her joy redoubled and she marvelled
and said in herself, “Would I wot how came he by all this
wealth!” In like manner the traders rejoiced in that which he
had given them and blessed him; whilst Merchant Ali marvelled
and said to himself, “I wonder how he hath lied and swindled,
that he hath gotten him all these treasures<a id='r73' href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a>? Had they come
from the King’s daughter, he had not wasted them on this wise!
But how excellent is his saying who said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the Kings’ King giveth, in reverence pause ✿ And venture not to enquire the cause:</div>
      <div class='line'>Allah gives His gifts unto whom He will, ✿ So respect and abide by His Holy Laws!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So far concerning him; but as regards the King, he also marvelled
with passing marvel at that which he saw of Ma’aruf’s generosity
and openhandedness in the largesse of wealth. Then the Merchant
went in to his wife, who met him, smiling and laughing-lipped
and kissed his hand, saying, “Didst thou mock me or hadst
thou a mind to prove me with thy saying:—I am a poor man and
a fugitive from my wife? Praised be Allah for that I failed not of
my duty to thee! For thou art my beloved and there is none
dearer to me than thou, whether thou be rich or poor. But I
would have thee tell me what didst thou design by these words.”
Said Ma’aruf, “I wished to prove thee and see whether thy love
were sincere or for the sake of wealth and the greed of worldly
good. But now ’tis become manifest to me that thine affection is
sincere and as thou art a true woman, so welcome to thee! I know
thy worth.” Then he went apart into a place by himself and
rubbed the seal-ring, whereupon Abu al-Sa’adat presented himself
and said to him, “Adsum, at thy service! Ask what thou wilt.”
Quoth Ma’aruf, “I want a treasure-suit and treasure-trinkets for
my wife, including a necklace of forty unique jewels.” Quoth the
Jinni, “To hear is to obey,” and brought him what he sought,
whereupon Ma’aruf dismissed him and carrying the dress and
ornaments in to his wife, laid them before her and said, “Take
these and put them on and welcome!” When she saw this, her
wits fled for joy, and she found among the ornaments a pair of
anklets of gold set with jewels of the handiwork of the magicians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and bracelets and earrings and a belt<a id='r74' href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a> such as no money could
buy. So she donned the dress and ornaments and said to Ma’aruf,
“O my lord, I will treasure these up for holidays and festivals.”
But he answered, “Wear them always, for I have others in plenty.”
And when she put them on and her women beheld her, they
rejoiced and bussed his hands. Then he left them and going
apart by himself, rubbed the seal-ring whereupon its slave appeared
and he said to him, “Bring me an hundred suits of apparel, with
their ornaments of gold.” “Hearing and obeying,” answered Abu
al Sa’adat and brought him the hundred suits, each with its ornaments
wrapped up within it. Ma’aruf took them and called aloud
to the slave-girls, who came to him and he gave them each a suit:
so they donned them and became like the black-eyed girls of
Paradise, whilst the Princess Dunya shone amongst them as the
moon among the stars. One of the handmaids told the King of
this and he came in to his daughter and saw her and her women
dazzling all who beheld them; whereat he wondered with passing
wonderment. Then he went out and calling his Wazir, said to
him, “O Wazir, such and such things have happened; what sayst
thou now of this affair?” Said he, “O King of the age, this be
no merchant’s fashion; for a merchant keepeth a piece of linen
by him for years and selleth it not but at a profit. How should
a merchant have generosity such as this generosity, and whence
should he get the like of these monies and jewels, of which but a
slight matter is found with the Kings? So how should loads
thereof be found with merchants? Needs must there be a cause
for this; but, an thou wilt hearken to me, I will make the truth of
the case manifest to thee.” Answered the King, “O Wazir, I will
do thy bidding.” Rejoined the Minister, “Do thou foregather
with thy son-in-law and make a show of affect to him and talk
with him and say:—O my son-in-law, I have a mind to go, I and
thou and the Wazir but no more, to a flower-garden that we may
take our pleasure there. When we come to the garden, we will
set on the table wine, and I will ply him therewith and compel
him to drink; for, when he shall have drunken, he will lose his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>reason and his judgment will forsake him. Then we will question
him of the truth of his case and he will discover to us his secrets,
for wine is a traitor and Allah-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When we drank the wine, and it crept its way ✿ To the place of Secrets, I cried, “O stay!”</div>
      <div class='line'>In my fear lest its influence stint my wits ✿ And my friends spy matters that hidden lay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When he hath told us the truth we shall ken his case and may
deal with him as we will; because I fear for thee the consequences
of this his present fashion: haply he will covet the kingship and
win over the troops by generosity and lavishing money and so
depose thee and take the kingdom from thee.” “True,” answered
the King.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Wazir devised this device the King said to him, “Thou hast spoken
sooth!”; and they passed the night on this agreement. And when
morning morrowed the King went forth and sat in the guest-chamber,
when lo, and behold! the grooms and serving-men came
in to him in dismay. Quoth he, “What hath befallen you?”;
and quoth they, “O King of the age, the Syces curried the horses
and foddered them and the he-mules which brought the baggage;
but, when we arose in the morning, we found that thy son-in-law’s
Mamelukes had stolen the horses and mules. We searched the
stables, but found neither horse nor mule; so we entered the
lodging of the Mamelukes and found none there, nor know we
how they fled.” The King marvelled at this, unknowing that the
horses and Mamelukes were all Ifrits, the subjects of the Slave
of the Spell, and asked the grooms, “O accursed how could a thousand
beasts and five hundred slaves and servants flee without your
knowledge?” Answered they, “We know not how it happened,”
and he cried, “Go, and when your lord cometh forth of the Harim,
tell him the case.” So they went out from before the King and
sat down bewildered, till Ma’aruf came out and, seeing them
chagrined enquired of them, “What may be the matter?” They
told him all that had happened and he said, “What is their worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that ye should be concerned for them? Wend your ways.” And
he sat laughing and was neither angry nor grieved concerning the
case; whereupon the King looked in the Wazir’s face and said
to him, “What manner of man is this, with whom wealth is of no
worth? Needs must there be a reason for this?” Then they
talked with him awhile and the King said to him, “O my son-in-law,
I have a mind to go, I, thou and the Wazir, to a garden,
where we may divert ourselves.” “No harm in that,” said Ma’aruf.
So they went forth to a flower-garden, wherein every sort of fruit
was of kinds twain and its waters were flowing and its trees
towering and its birds carolling. There they entered a pavilion,
whose sight did away sorrow from the soul, and sat talking, whilst
the Minister entertained them with rare tales and quoted merry
quips and mirth-provoking sayings and Ma’aruf attentively
listened, till the time of dinner came, when they set on a tray
of meats and a flagon of wine. When they had eaten and
washed hands, the Wazir filled the cup and gave it to the King,
who drank it off; then he filled a second and handed it to
Ma’aruf, saying, “Take the cup of the drink to which Reason
boweth neck in reverence.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “What is this, O
Wazir?”; and quoth he, “This is the grizzled<a id='r75' href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> virgin and the

<p class='c000'>And he ceased not to egg him on to the drink, naming to him
such of the virtues of wine as he thought well and reciting to him
what occurred to him of poetry and pleasantries on the subject, till
Ma’aruf addressed himself to sucking the cup-lips and cared no
longer for aught else. The Wazir ceased not to fill for him and he
to drink and enjoy himself and make merry, till his wits wandered
and he could not distinguish right from wrong. When the Minister
saw that drunkenness had attained in him to utterest and the
bounds transgressed, he said to him, “By Allah, O Merchant
Ma’aruf, I admire whence thou gottest these jewels whose like the
Kings of the Chosroës possess not! In all our lives never saw we
a merchant that had heaped up riches like unto thine or more
generous than thou, for thy doings are the doings of Kings and
not merchants’ doings. Wherefore, Allah upon thee, do thou
acquaint me with this, that I may know thy rank and condition.”
And he went on to test him with questions and cajole him, till
Ma’aruf, being reft of reason, said to him, “I’m neither merchant
nor King,” and told him his whole story from first to last. Then
said the Wazir, “I conjure thee by Allah, O my lord Ma’aruf,
show us the ring, that we may see its make.” So, in his drunkenness,
he pulled off the ring and said, “Take it and look upon it.”
The Minister took it and turning it over, said, “If I rub it, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>its slave appear?” Replied Ma’aruf, “Yes. Rub it and he will
appear to thee, and do thou divert thyself with the sight of him.”
Thereupon the Wazir rubbed the ring and behold forthright appeared
the Jinni and said, “Adsum, at thy service, O my lord!
Ask and it shall be given to thee. Wilt thou ruin a city or raise
a capital or kill a king? Whatso thou seekest, I will do for thee,
sans fail.” The Wazir pointed to Ma’aruf and said, “Take up
yonder wretch and cast him down in the most desolate of desert
lands, where he shall find nothing to eat nor drink, so he may die
of hunger and perish miserably, and none know of him.” Accordingly,
the Jinni snatched him up and flew with him betwixt heaven
and earth, which when Ma’aruf saw, he made sure of destruction
and wept and said, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, whither goest thou with
me?” Replied the Jinni, “I go to cast thee down in the Desert
Quarter,<a id='r91' href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> O ill-bred wight of gross wits. Shall one have the like
of this talisman and give it to the folk to gaze at? Verily, thou

I would let thee fall from a<a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> eight of a thousand fathoms, nor
shouldst thou reach the earth, till the winds had torn thee to
shreds.” Ma’aruf was silent<a id='r92' href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and did not again bespeak him till
he reached the Desert Quarter and casting him down there, went
away and left him in that horrible place.——And Shahrazad perceived

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>

<p class='c000'>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Slave
of the Seal-ring took up Ma’aruf and cast him down in the Desert
Quarter where he left him and went his ways. So much concerning
him; but returning to the Wazir who was now in possession
of the talisman, he said to the King, “How deemest thou now?
Did I not tell thee that this fellow was a liar, an impostor, but
thou wouldst not credit me?” Replied the King, “Thou wast in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the right, O my Wazir, Allah grant thee weal! But give me the
ring, that I may solace myself with the sight.” The Minister
looked at him angrily and spat in his face, saying, “O lack-wits,
how shall I give it to thee and abide thy servant, after I am
become thy master? But I will spare thee no more on life.” Then
he rubbed the seal-ring and said to the Slave, “Take up this ill-mannered
churl and cast him down by his son-in-law the swindler-man.”
So the Jinni took him up and flew off with him, whereupon
quoth the King to him, “O creature of my Lord, what is my
crime?” Abu al-Sa’adat replied, “That wot I not, but my master
hath commanded me and I cannot cross whoso hath compassed
the enchanted ring.” Then he flew on with him, till he came to
the Desert Quarter and, casting him down where he had cast
Ma’aruf left him and returned. The King hearing Ma’aruf weeping,
went up to him and acquainted him with his case; and they
sat weeping over that which had befallen them and found neither
meat nor drink. Meanwhile the Minister, after driving father-in-law
and son-in-law from the country, went forth from the garden
and summoning all the troops held a Divan, and told them what
he had done with the King and Ma’aruf and acquainted them
with the affair of the talisman, adding, “Unless ye make me Sultan
over you, I will bid the Slave of the Seal-ring take you up one and
all and cast you down in the Desert Quarter where you shall die
of hunger and thirst.” They replied, “Do us no damage, for we
accept thee as Sultan over us and will not anywise gainsay thy
bidding.” So they agreed, in their own despite, to his being
Sultan over them, and he bestowed on them robes of honour,
seeking all he had a mind to of Abu al-Sa’adat, who brought it to
him forthwith. Then he sat down on the throne and the troops
did homage to him; and he sent to Princess Dunya, the King’s
daughter, saying, “Make thee ready, for I mean to come in unto
thee this night, because I long for thee with love.” When she
heard this, she wept, for the case of her husband and father was
grievous to her, and sent to him saying, “Have patience with me
till my period of widowhood<a id='r93' href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a> be ended: then draw up thy contract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of marriage with me and go in to me according to law.” But he
sent back to say to her, “I know neither period of widowhood nor
to delay have I a mood; and I need not a contract nor know I
lawful from unlawful; but needs must I go in unto thee this night.”
She answered him saying, “So be it, then, and welcome to thee!”;
but this was a trick on her part. When the answer reached the
Wazir, he rejoiced and his breast was broadened, for that he was
passionately in love with her. He bade set food before all the
folk, saying, “Eat; this is my bride-feast; for I purpose to go in
to the Princess Dunya this night.” Quoth the Shaykh al-Islam,
“It is not lawful for thee to go in unto her till her days of widowhood
be ended and thou have drawn up thy contract of marriage
with her.” But he answered, “I know neither days of widowhood
nor other period; so multiply not words on me.” The Shaykh
Al-Islam was silent,<a id='r94' href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> fearing his mischief, and said to the troops,
“Verily, this man is a Kafir, a Miscreant, and hath neither creed
nor religious conduct.” As soon as it was evenfall, he went in to
her and found her robed in her richest raiment and decked with
her goodliest adornments. When she saw him, she came to meet
him, laughing and said, “A blessed night! But hadst thou slain
my father and my husband, it had been more to my mind.” And
he said, “There is no help but I slay them.” Then she made him
sit down and began to jest with him and make show of love
caressing him and smiling in his face so that his reason fled; but
she cajoled him with her coaxing and cunning only that she might
get possession of the ring and change his joy into calamity on the
mother of his forehead:<a id='r95' href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a> nor did she deal thus with him but after
the rede of him who said<a id='r96' href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>When he saw her caress him and smile upon him, desire surged up
in him and he besought her of carnal knowledge; but, when he
approached her, she drew away from him and burst into tears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>saying, “O my lord, seest thou not the man looking at us? I
conjure thee by Allah, screen me from his eyes! How canst thou
know me what while he looketh on us?” When he heard this, he
was angry and asked, “Where is the man?”; and answered she,
“There he is, in the bezel of the ring! putting out his head and
staring at us.” He thought that the Jinni was looking at them
and said laughing, “Fear not; this is the Slave of the Seal-ring,
and he is subject to me.” Quoth she, “I am afraid of Ifrits; pull
it off and throw it afar from me.” So he plucked it off and laying
it on the cushion, drew near to her, but she dealt him a kick, her
foot striking him full in the stomach<a id='r97' href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a>, and he fell over on his back
senseless; whereupon she cried out to her attendants, who came
to her in haste, and said to them, “Seize him!” So forty slave-girls
laid hold on him, whilst she hurriedly snatched up the ring
from the cushion and rubbed it; whereupon Abu al-Sa’adat presented
himself, saying, “Adsum, at thy service O my mistress.”
Cried she, “Take up yonder Infidel and clap him in jail and
shackle him heavily.” So he took him and throwing him into the
Prison of Wrath<a id='r98' href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a> returned and reported, “I have laid him in
limbo.” Quoth she, “Whither wentest thou with my father and
my husband?”; and quoth he, “I cast them down in the Desert
Quarter.” Then cried she, “I command thee to fetch them to me
forthwith.” He replied, “I hear and I obey,” and taking flight at
once, stayed not till he reached the Desert Quarter, where he
lighted down upon them and found them sitting weeping and complaining
each to other. Quoth he, “Fear not, for relief is come to
you”; and he told them what the Wazir had done, adding, “Indeed
I imprisoned him with my own hands in obedience to her, and she
hath bidden me bear you back.” And they rejoiced in his news.
Then he took them both up and flew home with them; nor was it
more than an hour before he brought them in to Princess Dunya,
who rose and saluted sire and spouse. Then she made them sit
down and brought them food and sweetmeats, and they passed the
rest of the night with her. On the next day she clad them in rich
clothing and said to the King, “O my papa, sit thou upon thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>throne and be King as before and make my husband thy Wazir of
the Right and tell thy troops that which hath happened. Then
send for the Minister out of prison and do him die, and after burn
him, for that he is a Miscreant, and would have gone in unto me
in the way of lewdness, without the rites of wedlock and he hath
testified against himself that he is an Infidel and believeth in no
religion. And do tenderly by thy son-in-law, whom thou makest
thy Wazir of the Right.” He replied, “Hearing and obeying, O
my daughter. But do thou give me the ring or give it to thy
husband.” Quoth she, “It behoveth not that either thou or he
have the ring. I will keep the ring myself, and belike I shall be
more careful of it than you. Whatso ye wish seek it of me and I
will demand it for you of the Slave of the Seal-ring. So fear no
harm so long as I live and after my death, do what ye twain will
with the ring.” Quoth the King, “This is the right rede, O my
daughter,” and taking his son-in-law went forth to the Divan.
Now the troops had passed the night in sore chagrin for Princess
Dunya and that which the Wazir had done with her, in going in to
her after the way of lewdness, without marriage-rites, and for his
ill-usage of the King and Ma’aruf, and they feared lest the law of
Al-Islam be dishonoured, because it was manifest to them that he
was a Kafir. So they assembled in the Divan and fell to reproaching
the Shaykh al-Islam, saying, “Why didst thou not forbid him
from going in to the Princess in the way of lewdness?” Said he,
“O folk, the man is a Miscreant and hath gotten possession of the
ring and I and you may not prevail against him. But Almighty
Allah will requite him his deed, and be ye silent, lest he slay you.”
And as the host was thus engaged in talk, behold the King and
Ma’aruf entered the Divan.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Thousandth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the troops sorely chagrined sat in the Divan talking over the ill-deeds
done by the Wazir to their Sovran, his son-in-law and his
daughter, behold, the King and Ma’aruf entered. Then the King
bade decorate the city and sent to fetch the Wazir from the place
of duresse. So they brought him, and as he passed by the troops,
they cursed him and abused him and menaced him, till he came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the King, who commanded to do him dead by the vilest of deaths.
Accordingly, they slew him and after burned his body, and he went
to Hell after the foulest of plights; and right well quoth one of
him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Compassionate show no ruth to the tomb where his bones shall lie ✿ And Munkar and eke Nakír<a id='r99' href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a> ne’er cease to abide thereby!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The King made Ma’aruf his Wazir of the Right and the times were
pleasant to them and their joys were untroubled. They abode
thus five years till, in the sixth year, the King died and Princess
Dunya made Ma’aruf Sultan in her father’s stead, but she gave
him not the seal-ring. During this time she had conceived by
him and borne him a boy of passing loveliness, excelling in beauty
and perfection, who ceased not to be reared in the laps of nurses
till he reached the age of five, when his mother fell sick of a deadly
sickness and calling her husband to her, said to him, “I am ill.”
Quoth he, “Allah preserve thee, O dearling of my heart!” But
quoth she, “Haply I shall die and thou needest not that I commend
to thy care thy son: wherefore I charge thee but be careful
of the ring, for thine own sake and for the sake of this thy boy.”
And he answered, “No harm shall befal him whom Allah preserveth!”
Then she pulled off the ring and gave it to him, and
on the morrow she was admitted to the mercy of Allah the Most
High,<a id='r100' href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a> whilst Ma’aruf abode in possession of the kingship and
applied himself to the business of governing. Now it chanced
that one day, as he shook the handkerchief<a id='r101' href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and the troops withdrew
to their places that he betook himself to the sitting-chamber,
where he sat till the day departed and the night advanced with
murks bedight. Then came in to him his cup-companions of the
notables according to their custom, and sat with him by way of
solace and diversion, till midnight, when they craved permission to
withdraw. He gave them leave and they retired to their houses;
after which there came in to him a slave-girl affected to the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of his bed, who spread him the mattress and doffing his apparel,
clad him in his sleeping-gown. Then he lay down and she kneaded
his feet, till sleep overpowered him; whereupon she withdrew to
her own chamber and slept. But suddenly he felt something beside
him in the bed and awaking started up in alarm and cried, “I
seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned!” Then he opened
his eyes and seeing by his side a woman foul of favour, said to her,
“Who art thou?” Said she, “Fear not, I am thy wife Fatimah
al-Urrah.” Whereupon he looked in her face and knew her by her
loathly form and the length of her dog-teeth: so he asked her,
“Whence camest thou in to me and who brought thee to this
country?” “In what country art thou at this present?” “In the
city of Ikhtiyan al-Khutan. But thou, when didst thou leave
Cairo?” “But now.” “How can that be?” “Know,” said she,
“that, when I fell out with thee and Satan prompted me to do thee
a damage, I complained of thee to the magistrates, who sought for
thee and the Kazis enquired of thee, but found thee not. When
two days were past, repentance gat hold upon me and I knew that
the fault was with me; but penitence availed me not, and I abode
for some days weeping for thy loss, till what was in my hand
failed and I was obliged to beg my bread. So I fell to begging of
all, from the courted rich to the contemned poor, and since thou
leftest me, I have eaten of the bitterness of beggary and have been
in the sorriest of conditions. Every night I sat beweeping our
separation and that which I suffered, since thy departure, of
humiliation and ignominy, of abjection and misery.” And she
went on to tell him what had befallen her, whilst he stared at her
in amazement, till she said, “Yesterday, I went about begging all
day but none gave me aught; and as often as I accosted any one
and craved of him a crust of bread, he reviled me and gave me
naught. When night came, I went to bed supperless, and hunger
burned me and sore on me was that which I suffered: and I sat
weeping when, behold, one appeared to me and said, O woman
why weepest thou? Said I, erst I had a husband who used to
provide for me and fulfil my wishes; but he is lost to me and I
know not whither he went and have been in sore straits since he
left me. Asked he, What is thy husband’s name? and I answered,
His name is Ma’aruf. Quoth he, I ken him. Know that thy
husband is now Sultan in a certain city, and if thou wilt, I will
carry thee to him. Cried I, I am under thy protection: of thy
bounty bring me to him! So he took me up and flew with me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>between heaven and earth, till he brought me to this pavilion and
said to me:—Enter yonder chamber, and thou shalt see thy
husband asleep on the couch. Accordingly I entered and found
thee in this state of lordship. Indeed I had not thought thou
wouldst forsake me, who am thy mate, and praised be Allah
who hath united thee with me!” Quoth Ma’aruf, “Did I forsake
thee or thou me? Thou complainedst of me from Kazi to
Kazi and endedst by denouncing me to the High Court and
bringing down on me Abú Tabak from the Citadel: so I fled
in mine own despite.” And he went on to tell her all that had
befallen him and how he was become Sultan and had married
the King’s daughter and how his beloved Dunya had died,
leaving him a son who was then seven years old. She
rejoined, “That which happened was fore-ordained of Allah;
but I repent me and I place myself under thy protection
beseeching thee not to abandon me, but suffer me eat bread, with
thee by way of an alms.” And she ceased not to humble herself
to him and to supplicate him till his heart relented towards her
and he said, “Repent from mischief and abide with me, and naught
shall betide thee save what shall pleasure thee: but, an thou work
any wickedness, I will slay thee nor fear any one. And fancy not
that thou canst complain of me to the High Court and that Abu
Tabak will come down on me from the Citadel; for I am become
Sultan and the folk dread me: but I fear none save Allah Almighty,
because I have a talismanic ring which when I rub, the Slave of
the Signet appeareth to me. His name is Abu al-Sa’adat, and
whatsoever I demand of him he bringeth to me. So, an thou
desire to return to thine own country, I will give thee what shall
suffice thee all thy life long and will send thee thither speedily;
but, an thou desire to abide with me, I will clear for thee a palace
and furnish it with the choicest of silks and appoint thee twenty
slave-girls to serve thee and provide thee with dainty dishes and
sumptuous suits, and thou shalt be a Queen and live in all delight
till thou die or I die. What sayest thou of this?” “I wish to
abide with thee,” she answered and kissed his hand and vowed
repentance from frowardness. Accordingly he set apart a palace
for her sole use and gave her slave-girls and eunuchs, and she
became a Queen. The young Prince used to visit her as he visited
his sire; but she hated him for that he was not her son; and
when the boy saw that she looked on him with the eye of aversion
and anger, he shunned her and took a dislike to her. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>for Ma’aruf, he occupied himself with the love of fair handmaidens
and bethought him not of his wife Fatimah the Dung,
for that she was grown a grizzled old fright, foul-favoured to the
sight, a bald-headed blight, loathlier than the snake speckled black
and white; the more that she had beyond measure evil entreated
him aforetime; and as saith the adage, “Ill-usage the root of
desire disparts and sows hate in the soil of hearts;” and God-gifted
is he who saith:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Beware of losing hearts of men by thine injurious deed; ✿ For when Aversion takes his place none may dear Love restore:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hearts, when affection flies from them, are likest unto glass ✿ Which broken, cannot whole be made,—’tis breached for evermore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And indeed Ma’aruf had not given her shelter by reason of any
praiseworthy quality in her, but he dealt with her thus generously
only of desire for the approval of Allah Almighty.—Here Dunyazad
interrupted her sister Shahrazad, saying, “How winsome are
these words of thine which win hold of the heart more forcibly
than enchanters’ eyne; and how beautiful are these wondrous
books thou hast cited and the marvellous and singular tales thou
hast recited!” Quoth Shahrazad, “And where is all this compared
with what I shall relate to thee on the coming night, an I
live and the King deign spare my days?” So when morning
morrowed and the day brake in its sheen and shone, the King
arose from his couch with breast broadened and in high expectation
for the rest of the tale and saying, “By Allah, I will not
slay her till I hear the last of her story;” repaired to his Durbár
while the Wazir, as was his wont, presented himself at the Palace,
shroud under arm. Shahriyar tarried abroad all that day,
bidding and forbidding between man and man; after which he
returned to his Harim and, according to his custom went in to his
wife Shahrazad.<a id='r102' href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Now when it was the Thousand and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Dunyazad said to her sister, “Do thou finish for us the History of
Ma’aruf!” She replied, “With love and goodly gree, an my lord
deign permit me recount it.” Quoth the King, “I permit thee;
for that I am fain of hearing it.” So she said:—It hath reached
me, O auspicious King, that Ma’aruf would have naught to do
with his wife by way of conjugal duty. Now when she saw
that he held aloof from her bed and occupied himself with other
women, she hated him and jealousy gat the mastery of her and
Iblis prompted her to take the seal-ring from him and slay him
and make herself Queen in his stead. So she went forth one
night from her pavilion, intending for that in which was her
husband King Ma’aruf; and it chanced by decree of the Decreer
and His written destiny, that Ma’aruf lay that night with one of
his concubines; a damsel endowed with beauty and loveliness,
symmetry and a stature all grace. And it was his wont, of the
excellence of his piety, that, when he was minded to have to lie
with a woman, he would doff the enchanted seal-ring from his
finger, in reverence to the Holy Names graven thereon, and lay it
on the pillow, nor would he don it again till he had purified himself
by the Ghusl-ablution. Moreover, when he had lain with a
woman, he was used to order her go forth from him before daybreak,
of his fear for the seal-ring; and when he went to the
Hammam he locked the door of the pavilion till his return,
when he put on the ring, and after this, all were free to enter
according to custom. His wife Fatimah the Dung knew of all
this and went not forth from her place till she had certified
herself of the case. So she sallied out, when the night was
dark, purposing to go in to him, whilst he was drowned in sleep,
and steal the ring, unseen of him. Now it chanced at this time
that the King’s son had gone out, without light, to the Chapel of
Ease for an occasion, and sat down over the marble slab<a id='r103' href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a> of the
jakes in the dark, leaving the door open. Presently, he saw
Fatimah come forth of her pavilion and make stealthily for that of
his father and said in himself, “What aileth this witch to leave her
lodging in the dead of the night and make for my father’s pavilion?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Needs must there be some reason for this:” so he went out after
her and followed in her steps unseen of her. Now he had a short
sword of watered steel, which he held so dear that he went not to
his father’s Divan, except he were girt therewith; and his father
used to laugh at him and exclaim, “Mahallah!<a id='r104' href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a> This is a mighty
fine sword of thine, O my son! But thou hast not gone down
with it to battle nor cut off a head therewith.” Whereupon the
boy would reply, “I will not fail to cut off with it some head which
deserveth<a id='r105' href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> cutting.” And Ma’aruf would laugh at his words.
Now when treading in her track, he drew the sword from its
sheath and he followed her till she came to his father’s pavilion and
entered, whilst he stood and watched her from the door. He saw
her searching about and heard her say to herself, “Where hath he
laid the seal-ring?”; whereby he knew that she was looking for
the ring and he waited till she found it and said, “Here it is.”
Then she picked it up and turned to go out; but he hid behind
the door. As she came forth, she looked at the ring and turned it
about in her grasp. But when she was about to rub it, he raised
his hand with the sword and smote her on the neck; and she cried
a single cry and fell down dead. With this Ma’aruf awoke and
seeing his wife strown on the ground, with her blood flowing, and
his son standing with the drawn sword in his hand, said to him,
“What is this, O my son?” He replied, “O my father, how often
hast thou said to me, Thou hast a mighty fine sword; but thou
hast not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head. And I
have answered thee, saying, I will not fail to cut off with it a head
which deserveth cutting. And now, behold, I have therewith cut
off for thee a head well worth the cutting!” And he told him
what had passed. Ma’aruf sought for the Seal-ring, but found it
not; so he searched the dead woman’s body till he saw her hand
closed upon it; whereupon he took it from her grasp and said to
the boy, “Thou art indeed my very son, without doubt or dispute;
Allah ease thee in this world and the next, even as thou hast eased
me of this vile woman! Her attempt led only to her own destruction,
and Allah-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>When forwards Allah’s aid a man’s intent, ✿ His wish in every case shall find consent:</div>
      <div class='line'>But an that aid of Allah be refused, ✿ His first attempt shall do him damagement.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then King Ma’aruf called aloud to some of his attendants, who
came in haste, and he told them what his wife Fatimah the Dung
had done and bade them to take her and lay her in a place till the
morning. They did his bidding, and next day he gave her in
charge to a number of eunuchs, who washed her and shrouded her
and made her a tomb<a id='r106' href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a> and buried her. Thus her coming from
Cairo was but to her grave, and Allah-gifted is he who said<a id='r107' href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We trod the steps appointed for us: and he whose steps are appointed must tread them.</div>
      <div class='line'>He whose death is decreed to take place in our land shall not die in any land but that.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And how excellent is the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I wot not, whenas to a land I fare, ✿ Good luck pursuing, what my lot shall be.</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether the fortune I perforce pursue ✿ Or the misfortune which pursueth me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After this, King Ma’aruf sent for the husbandman, whose guest he
had been, when he was a fugitive, and made him his Wazir of the
Right and his Chief Counsellor.<a id='r108' href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> Then, learning that he had a
daughter of passing beauty and loveliness, of qualities nature-ennobled
at birth and exalted of worth, he took her to wife; and
in due time he married his son. So they abode awhile in all solace
of life and its delight and their days were serene and their joys
untroubled, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and
the Sunderer of societies, the Depopulator of populous places and
the Orphaner of sons and daughters. And glory be to the Living
who dieth not and in whose hand are the Keys of the Seen and the
Unseen!”</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>Conclusion.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Now, during this time, Shahrazad had borne the King three boy
children: so, when she had made an end of the story of Ma’aruf,
she rose to her feet and kissing ground before him, said, “O King of
the time and unique one<a id='r109' href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> of the age and the tide, I am thine handmaid
and these thousand nights and a night have I entertained
thee with stories of folk gone before and admonitory instances of
the men of yore. May I then make bold to crave a boon of Thy
Highness?” He replied, “Ask, O Shahrazad, and it shall be
granted to thee.<a id='r110' href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a>” Whereupon she cried out to the nurses and the
eunuchs, saying, “Bring me my children.” So they brought them
to her in haste, and they were three boy children, one walking, one
crawling and one sucking. She took them and setting them before
the King, again kissed the ground and said, “O King of the age,
these are thy children and I crave that thou release me from the
doom of death, as a dole to these infants; for, an thou kill me,
they will become motherless and will find none among women to
rear them as they should be reared.” When the King heard this,
he wept and straining the boys to his bosom, said, “By Allah, O
Shahrazad, I pardoned thee before the coming of these children, for
that I found thee chaste, pure, ingenuous and pious! Allah bless
thee and thy father and thy mother and thy root and thy branch!
I take the Almighty to witness against me that I exempt thee
from aught that can harm thee.” So she kissed his hands and
feet and rejoiced with exceeding joy, saying, “The Lord make thy
life long and increase thee in dignity and majesty<a id='r111' href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a>!”; presently
adding, “Thou marvelledst at that which befel thee on the part of
women; yet there betided the Kings of the Chosroës before thee
greater mishaps and more grievous than that which hath befallen
thee, and indeed I have set forth unto thee that which happened
to Caliphs and Kings and others with their women, but the relation
is longsome and hearkening groweth tedious, and in this is all-sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>warning for the man of wits and admonishment for the
wise.” Then she ceased to speak, and when King Shahriyar heard
her speech and profited by that which she said, he summoned up
his reasoning powers and cleansed his heart and caused his understanding
revert and turned to Allah Almighty and said to himself,
“Since there befel the Kings of the Chosroës more than that which
hath befallen me, never, whilst I live, shall I cease to blame myself
for the past. As for this Shahrazad, her like is not found in the
lands; so praise be to Him who appointed her a means for
delivering His creatures from oppression and slaughter!” Then
he arose from his séance and kissed her head, whereat she rejoiced,
she and her sister Dunyazad, with exceeding joy. When the
morning morrowed, the King went forth and sitting down on the
throne of the Kingship, summoned the Lords of his land; whereupon
the Chamberlains and Nabobs and Captains of the host went
in to him and kissed ground before him. He distinguished the
Wazir, Shahrazad’s sire, with special favour and bestowed on him
a costly and splendid robe of honour and entreated him with the
utmost kindness, and said to him, “Allah protect thee for that thou
gavest me to wife thy noble daughter, who hath been the means of
my repentance from slaying the daughters of folk. Indeed I have
found her pure and pious, chaste and ingenuous, and Allah hath
vouchsafed me by her three boy children; wherefore praised be
He for his passing favour.” Then he bestowed robes of honour
upon his Wazirs, and Emirs and Chief Officers and he set forth to
them briefly that which had betided him with Shahrazad and how
he had turned from his former ways and repented him of what he
had done and purposed to take the Wazir’s daughter, Shahrazad,
to wife and let draw up the marriage-contract with her. When
those who were present heard this, they kissed the ground before
him and blessed him and his betrothed<a id='r112' href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Shahrazad, and the Wazir
thanked her. Then Shahriyar made an end of his sitting in all
weal, whereupon the folk dispersed to their dwelling-places and the
news was bruited abroad that the King purposed to marry the
Wazir’s daughter, Shahrazad. Then he proceeded to make ready
the wedding gear, and presently he sent after his brother, King
Shah Zaman, who came, and King Shahriyar went forth to meet
him with the troops. Furthermore, they decorated the city after
the goodliest fashion and diffused scents from censers and burnt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>aloes-wood and other perfumes in all the markets and thoroughfares
and rubbed themselves with saffron,<a id='r113' href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a> what while the drums
beat and the flutes and pipes sounded and mimes and mountebanks
played and plied their arts and the King lavished on them gifts
and largesse; and in very deed it was a notable day. When they
came to the palace, King Shahriyar commanded to spread the
tables with beasts roasted whole and sweetmeats and all manner
of viands and bade the crier cry to the folk that they should come
up to the Divan and eat and drink and that this should
be a means of reconciliation between him and them. So,
high and low, great and small came up unto him and they
abode on that wise, eating and drinking, seven days with their
nights. Then the King shut himself up with his brother and
related to him that which had betided him with the Wazir’s
daughter, Shahrazad, during the past three years and told him
what he had heard from her of proverbs and parables, chronicles
and pleasantries, quips and jests, stories and anecdotes, dialogues
and histories and elegies and other verses; whereat King Shah
Zaman marvelled with the uttermost marvel and said, “Fain
would I take her younger sister to wife, so we may be two
brothers-german to two sisters-german, and they on like wise be
sisters to us; for that the calamity which befel me was the cause
of our discovering that which befel thee and all this time of three
years past I have taken no delight in woman, save that I lie each
night with a damsel of my kingdom, and every morning I do her
to death; but now I desire to marry thy wife’s sister Dunyazad.”
When King Shahriyar heard his brother’s words, he rejoiced with
joy exceeding and arising forthright, went in to his wife Shahrazad
and acquainted her with that which his brother purposed, namely
that he sought her sister Dunyazad in wedlock; whereupon she
answered, “O King of the age, we seek of him one condition, to
wit, that he take up his abode with us, for that I cannot brook to
be parted from my sister an hour, because we were brought up
together and may not endure separation each from other.<a id='r114' href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a> If he
accept this pact, she is his handmaid.” King Shahriyar returned
to his brother and acquainted him with that which Shahrazad had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>said; and he replied, “Indeed, this is what was in my mind, for
that I desire nevermore to be parted from thee one hour. As
for the kingdom, Allah the Most High shall send to it whomso
He chooseth, for that I have no longer a desire for the kingship.”
When King Shahriyar heard his brother’s words, he rejoiced
exceedingly and said, “Verily, this is what I wished, O my
brother. So Alhamdolillah—Praised be Allah—who hath brought
about union between us.” Then he sent after the Kazis and
Olema, Captains and Notables, and they married the two brothers
to the two sisters. The contracts were written out and the two
Kings bestowed robes of honour of silk and satin on those who
were present, whilst the city was decorated and the rejoicings
were renewed. The King commanded each Emir and Wazir and
Chamberlain and Nabob to decorate his palace and the folk of
the city were gladdened by the presage of happiness and contentment.
King Shahriyar also bade slaughter sheep and set up
kitchens and made bride-feasts and fed all comers, high and low;
and he gave alms to the poor and needy and extended his bounty
to great and small. Then the eunuchs went forth, that they might
perfume the Hammam for the brides; so they scented it with rose-water
and willow-flower-water and pods of musk and fumigated it
with Kákilí<a id='r115' href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a> eagle-wood and ambergris. Then Shahrazad entered,
she and her sister Dunyazad, and they cleansed their heads and
clipped their hair. When they came forth of the Hammam-bath,
they donned raiment and ornaments; such as men were wont
prepare for the Kings of the Chosroës; and among Shahrazad’s
apparel was a dress purfled with red gold and wrought with
counterfeit presentments of birds and beasts. And the two
sisters encircled their necks with necklaces of jewels of price,
in the like whereof Iskander<a id='r116' href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a> rejoiced not, for therein were
great jewels such as amazed the wit and dazzled the eye; and
the imagination was bewildered at their charms, for indeed each
of them was brighter than the sun and the moon. Before them
they lighted brilliant flambeaux of wax in candelabra of gold,
but their faces outshone the flambeaux, for that they had eyes
sharper than unsheathed swords and the lashes of their eyelids
bewitched all hearts. Their cheeks were rosy red and their necks
and shapes gracefully swayed and their eyes wantoned like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>gazelle’s; and the slave-girls came to meet them with instruments
of music. Then the two Kings entered the Hammam-bath, and
when they came forth, they sat down on a couch set with pearls
and gems, whereupon the two sisters came up to them and stood
between their hands, as they were moons, bending and leaning
from side to side in their beauty and loveliness. Presently they
brought forward Shahrazad and displayed her, for the first dress,
in a red suit; whereupon King Shahriyar rose to look upon her
and the wits of all present, men and women, were bewitched for
that she was even as saith of her one of her describers<a id='r117' href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed, ✿ Clad in her cramoisy-hued chemisette:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her lips’ honey-dew she gave me drink ✿ And with her rosy cheeks quencht fire she set.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then they attired Dunyazad in a dress of blue brocade and she
became as she were the full moon when it shineth forth. So they
displayed her in this, for the first dress, before King Shah Zaman,
who rejoiced in her and well-nigh swooned away for love-longing
and amorous desire; yea, he was distraught with passion for
her, whenas he saw her, because she was as saith of her one of
her describers in these couplets<a id='r118' href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a>:-</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She comes apparelled in an azure vest ✿ Ultramarine as skies are deckt and dight:</div>
      <div class='line'>I view’d th’ unparallel’d sight, which showed my eyes ✿ A Summer-moon upon a Winter-night.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then they returned to Shahrazad and displayed her in the second
dress, a suit of surpassing goodliness, and veiled her face with her
hair like a chin-veil.<a id='r119' href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Moreover, they let down her side-locks
and she was even as saith of her one of her describers in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O hail to him whose locks his cheeks o’ershade, ✿ Who slew my life by cruel hard despight:</div>
      <div class='line'>Said I, “Hast veiled the Morn in Night?” He said, ✿ “Nay I but veil Moon in hue of Night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Then they displayed Dunyazad in a second and a third and a
fourth dress and she paced forward like the rising sun, and swayed
to and fro in the insolence of beauty; and she was even as saith
the poet of her in these couplets<a id='r120' href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The sun of beauty she to all appears ✿ And, lovely coy she mocks all loveliness:</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he fronts her favour and her smile ✿ A-morn, the sun of day in clouds must dress.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then they displayed Shahrazad in the third dress and the fourth
and the fifth and she became as she were a Bán-branch snell or a
thirsting gazelle, lovely of face and perfect in attributes of grace,
even as saith of her one in these couplets<a id='r121' href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She comes like fullest moon on happy night, ✿ Taper of waist with shape of magic might:</div>
      <div class='line'>She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind, ✿ And ruby on her cheeks reflects his light:</div>
      <div class='line'>Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair; ✿ Beware of curls that bite with viper-bite!</div>
      <div class='line'>Her sides are silken-soft, that while the heart ✿ Mere rock behind that surface ’scapes our sight:</div>
      <div class='line'>From the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots ✿ Shafts that at furthest range on mark alight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then they returned to Dunyazad and displayed her in the fifth
dress and in the sixth, which was green, when she surpassed
with her loveliness the fair of the four quarters of the world and
outvied, with the brightness of her countenance, the full moon at
rising tide; for she was even as saith of her the poet in these
couplets<a id='r122' href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A damsel ’twas the tirer’s art had decked with snare and sleight, ✿ And robed with rays as though the sun from her had borrowed light:</div>
      <div class='line'>She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green, ✿ As veilèd by his leafy screen Pomegranate hides from sight:</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he said, “How callest thou the fashion of thy dress?” ✿ She answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight,</div>
      <div class='line'>“We call this garment <i><span lang="fr">crève-cœur</span></i>; and rightly is it hight, ✿ For many a heart wi’ this we brake and harried many a sprite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Then they displayed Shahrazad in the sixth and seventh dresses
and clad her in youth’s clothing, whereupon she came forward
swaying from side to side and coquettishly moving and indeed she
ravished wits and hearts and ensorcelled all eyes with her glances.
She shook her sides and swayed her haunches, then put her hair
on sword-hilt and went up to King Shahriyar, who embraced her
as hospitable host embraceth guest, and threatened her in her ear
with the taking of the sword; and she was even as saith of her the
poet in these words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Were not the Murk<a id='r123' href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a> of gender male, ✿ Than feminines surpassing fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tirewomen they had grudged the bride, ✿ Who made her beard and whiskers wear!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus also they did with her sister Dunyazad, and when they had
made an end of the display the King bestowed robes of honour
on all who were present and sent the brides to their own apartments.
Then Shahrazad went in to King Shahriyar and
Dunyazad to King Shah Zaman and each of them solaced himself
with the company of his beloved consort and the hearts of the
folk were comforted. When morning morrowed, the Wazir came
in to the two Kings and kissed ground before them; wherefore
they thanked him and were large of bounty to him. Presently
they went forth and sat down upon couches of Kingship, whilst
all the Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees and Lords of the land
presented themselves and kissed ground. King Shahriyar ordered
them dresses of honour and largesse and they prayed for the
permanence and prosperity of the King and his brother. Then
the two Sovrans appointed their sire-in-law the Wazir to be
Viceroy in Samarcand and assigned him five of the Chief Emirs to
accompany him, charging them attend him and do him service.
The Minister kissed the ground and prayed that they might
be vouchsafed length of life: then he went in to his daughters,
whilst the Eunuchs and Ushers walked before him, and
saluted them and farewelled them. They kissed his hands
and gave him joy of the Kingship and bestowed on him
immense treasures; after which he took leave of them and
setting out, fared days and nights, till he came near Samarcand,
where the townspeople met him at a distance of three
marches and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy. So he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>entered the city and they decorated the houses and it was
a notable day. He sat down on the throne of his kingship
and the Wazirs did him homage and the Grandees and Emirs
of Samarcand and all prayed that he might be vouchsafed
justice and victory and length of continuance. So he bestowed
on them robes of honour and entreated them with distinction and
they made him Sultan over them. As soon as his father-in-law
had departed for Samarcand, King Shahriyah summoned the
Grandees of his realm and made them a stupendous banquet of
all manner of delicious meats and exquisite sweetmeats. He also
bestowed on them robes of honour and guerdoned them and
divided the kingdoms between himself and his brother in their
presence, whereat the folk rejoiced. Then the two Kings abode,
each ruling a day in turn, and they were ever in harmony each
with other while on similar wise their wives continued in the love
of Allah Almighty and in thanksgiving to Him; and the peoples
and the provinces were at peace and the preachers prayed for
them from the pulpits, and their report was bruited abroad and
the travellers bore tidings of them to all lands. In due time
King Shahriyah summoned chroniclers and copyists and bade
them write all that had betided him with his wife, first and last;
so they wrote this and named it “<b>The Stories of the Thousand
Nights and A Night</b>.” The book came to thirty volumes and these
the King laid up in his treasury. And the two brothers abode with
their wives in all pleasance and solace of life and its delights, for
that indeed Allah the Most High had changed their annoy into joy;
and on this wise they continued till there took them the Destroyer
of delights and the Severer of societies, the Desolator of dwelling-places
and Garnerer of grave-yards, and they were translated to
the ruth of Almighty Allah; their houses fell waste and their
palaces lay in ruins<a id='r124' href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> and the Kings inherited their riches. Then
there reigned after them a wise ruler, who was just, keen-witted
and accomplished and loved tales and legends, especially those
which chronicle the doings of Sovrans and Sultans, and he found
in the treasury these marvellous stories and wondrous histories,
contained in the thirty volumes aforesaid. So he read in them a
first book and a second and a third and so on to the last of them,
and each book astounded and delighted him more than that which
preceded it, till he came to the end of them. Then he admired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>whatso he had read therein of description and discourse and rare
traits and anecdotes and moral instances and reminiscences and
bade the folk copy them and dispread them over all lands and
climes; wherefore their report was bruited abroad and the people
named them “<b>The marvels and wonders of the Thousand Nights
and A Night</b>.” This is all that hath come down to us of the
origin of this book, and Allah is All-knowing.<a id='r125' href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a> So Glory be to
Him whom the shifts of Time waste not away, nor doth aught
of chance or change affect His sway: whom one case diverteth not
from other case and Who is sole in the attributes of perfect grace.
And prayer and peace be upon the Lord’s Pontiff and Chosen
One among His creatures, our lord MOHAMMED the Prince
of mankind through whom we supplicate Him for a goodly and
a godly</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>Terminal Essay.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'>PRELIMINARY.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The reader who has reached this terminal stage will hardly
require my assurance that he has seen the mediæval Arab at his
best and, perhaps, at his worst. In glancing over the myriad
pictures of this panorama, those who can discern the soul of goodness
in things evil will note the true nobility of the Moslem’s
mind in the Moyen Age, and the cleanliness of his life from cradle
to grave. As a child he is devoted to his parents, fond of his
comrades and respectful to his “pastors and masters,” even schoolmasters.
As a lad he prepares for manhood with a will and
this training occupies him throughout youth-tide: he is a
gentleman in manners without awkwardness, vulgar astonishment
or <span lang="fr">mauvaise-honte</span>. As a man he is high-spirited and energetic,
always ready to fight for his Sultan, his country and, especially,
his Faith: courteous and affable, rarely failing in temperance of
mind and self-respect, self-control and self-command: hospitable
to the stranger, attached to his fellow-citizens, submissive to
superiors and kindly to inferiors—if such classes exist: Eastern
despotisms have arrived nearer the idea of equality and fraternity
than any republic yet invented. As a friend he proves a model
to the Damons and Pythiases: as a lover an exemplar to Don
Quijote without the noble old Caballero’s touch of eccentricity. As
a knight he is the mirror of chivalry, doing battle for the weak and
debelling the strong, while ever “defending the honour of women.”
As a husband his patriarchal position causes him to be loved and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>fondly loved by more than one wife: as a father affection for his
children rules his life: he is domestic in the highest degree and he
finds few pleasures beyond the bosom of his family. Lastly, his
death is simple, path ethic and edifying as the life which led to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considered in a higher phase, the mediæval Moslem mind displays,
like the ancient Egyptian, a most exalted moral idea, the
deepest reverence for all things connected with his religion and a
sublime conception of the Unity and Omnipotence of the Deity.
Noteworthy too is a proud resignation to the decrees of Fate and
Fortune (Kazá wa Kadar), of Destiny and Predestination—a
feature which ennobles the low aspect of Al-Islam even in these
her days of comparative degeneration and local decay. Hence his
moderation in prosperity, his fortitude in adversity, his dignity,
his perfect self-dominance and, lastly, his lofty quietism which
sounds the true heroic ring. This again is softened and tempered
by a simple faith in the supremacy of Love over Fear, an unbounded
humanity and charity for the poor and helpless: an unconditional
forgiveness of the direst injuries (“which is the note of
the noble”); a generosity and liberality which at times seem
impossible and an enthusiasm for universal benevolence and
beneficence which, exalting kindly deeds done to man above every
form of holiness, constitute the root and base of Oriental, nay, of
all, courtesy. And the whole is crowned by pure trust and natural
confidence in the progress and perfectability of human nature,
which he exalts instead of degrading; this he holds to be the
foundation-stone of society and indeed the very purpose of its existence.
His Pessimism resembles far more the optimism which
the so-called Books of Moses borrowed from the Ancient Copt
than the mournful and melancholy creed of the true Pessimist,
as Solomon the Hebrew, the Indian Buddhist and the esoteric
European imitators of Buddhism. He cannot but sigh when contemplating
the sin and sorrow, the pathos and bathos of the
world; and feel the pity of it, with its shifts and changes ending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>in nothingness, its scanty happiness and its copious misery. But
his melancholy is expressed in—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A voice divinely sweet, a voice no less</div>
      <div class='line'>Divinely sad.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor does he mourn as they mourn who have no hope: he has
an absolute conviction in future compensation; and, meanwhile,
his lively poetic impulse, the poetry of ideas, not of formal verse,
and his radiant innate idealism breathe a soul into the merest
matter of squalid work-a-day life and awaken the sweetest
harmonies of Nature epitomised in Humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the Moslem at a time when “the dark clouds of
ignorance and superstition hung so thick on the intellectual
horizon of Europe as to exclude every ray of learning that darted
from the East and when all that was polite or elegant in literature
was classed among the <i><span lang="la">Studia Arabum</span></i>.”<a id='r126' href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is the shady side of the picture less notable. Our Arab at
his worst is a mere barbarian who has not forgotten the savage.
He is a model mixture of childishness and astuteness, of simplicity
and cunning, concealing levity of mind under solemnity of aspect.
His stolid instinctive conservatism grovels before the tyrant rule of
routine, despite that turbulent and licentious independence which
ever suggests revolt against the ruler: his mental torpidity,
founded upon physical indolence, renders immediate action and
all manner of exertion distasteful: his conscious weakness shows
itself in overweening arrogance and intolerance. His crass and
self-satisfied ignorance makes him glorify the most ignoble superstitions,
while acts of revolting savagery are the natural results of
a malignant fanaticism and a furious hatred of every creed beyond
the pale of Al-Islam.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be confessed that these contrasts make a curious and
interesting tout ensemble.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ I<br > THE ORIGIN OF THE NIGHTS.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>A.—The Birthplace.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Here occur the questions, Where and When was written and to
Whom do we owe a prose-poem which, like the dramatic epos of
Herodotus, has no equal?</p>

<p class='c000'>I proceed to lay before the reader a <span lang="fr">procès-verbal</span> of the
sundry pleadings already in court as concisely as is compatible
with intelligibility, furnishing him with references to original
authorities and warning him that a fully-detailed account would
fill a volume. Even my own reasons for decidedly taking one
side and rejecting the other must be stated briefly. And before
entering upon this subject I would distribute the prose-matter
of our <span lang="fr">Recueil</span> of Folk-lore under three heads.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The Apologue or Beast-fable proper, a theme which may
be of any age, as it is found in the hieroglyphs and in the
cuneiforms.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The Fairy-tale, as for brevity we may term the stories
based upon supernatural agency: this was a favourite with
olden Persia; and Mohammed, most austere and puritanical of
the “Prophets,” strongly objected to it because preferred by the
more sensible of his converts to the dry legends of the Talmud
and the Koran, quite as fabulous without the halo and glamour
of fancy.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The Histories and historical anecdotes, analects, and acroamata,
in which the names, when not used anachronistically by
the editor or copier, give unerring data for the earliest date <span lang="fr">à
quo</span> and which, by the mode of treatment, suggest the latest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Each of these constituents will require further notice when
the subject-matter of the book is discussed. The metrical portion
of The Nights may also be divided into three categories,
viz.:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The oldest and classical poetry of the Arabs, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> the
various quotations from the “Suspended Poems.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The mediæval, beginning with the laureates of Al-Rashid’s
court, such as Al-Asma’í and Abú Nowás; and ending with
Al-Harírí A.H. 446–516 = 1030–1100.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The modern quotations and the <i><span lang="fr">pièces de circonstance</span></i> by
the editors or copyists of the Compilation.<a id='r127' href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the metrical portion also further notices must be offered
at the end of this Essay.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering the <span lang="la">unde derivatur</span> of The Nights we must
carefully separate subject-matter from language-manner. The
neglect of such essential difference has caused the remark, “It
is not a little curious that the origin of a work which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>known to Europe and has been studied by many during nearly
two centuries, should still be so mysterious, and that students
have failed in all attempts to detect the secret.” Hence also
the chief authorities at once branched off into two directions.
One held the work to be practically Persian: the other as persistently
declared it to be purely Arab.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Galland, in his Epistle Dedicatory to the Marquise
d’O, daughter of his patron M. de Guillerague, showed his
literary acumen and unfailing sagacity by deriving The Nights
from India viâ <em>Persia</em>; and held that they had been reduced to
their present shape by an <i><span lang="fr">Auteur Arabe inconnu</span></i>. This reference
to India, also learnedly advocated by M: Langlès, was
inevitable in those days: it had not then been proved that
India owed all her literature to far older civilisations and even
that her alphabet the Nágari, erroneously called Devanágari,
was derived through Phœnicia and Himyar-land from Ancient
Egypt. So Europe was contented to compare The Nights
with the Fables of Pilpay for upwards of a century. At last
the Pehlevi or old Iranian origin of the work found an able
and strenuous advocate in Baron von Hammer-Purgstall<a id='r128' href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a> who
worthily continued what Galland had begun: although a most
inexact writer, he was extensively read in Oriental history and
poetry. His contention was that the book is an Arabisation
of the Persian Hazár Afsánah or Thousand Tales and he
proved his point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Von Hammer began by summoning into Court the “Herodotus
of the Arabs, (Ali Abú al-Hasan) Al-Mas’údi who, in A.H. 333
(= 944) about one generation before the founding of Cairo,
published at Bassorah the first edition of his far-famed Murúj
al-Dahab wa Ma’ádin al-Jauhar, Meads of Gold and Mines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Gems. The Styrian Orientalist<a id='r129' href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a> quotes with sundry misprints<a id='r130' href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a> an
ampler version of a passage in Chapter lxviii., which is abbreviated
in the French translation of M. C. Barbier de Meynard.<a id='r131' href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“And, indeed, many men well acquainted with their (Arab)
histories<a id='r132' href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a> opine that the stories above mentioned and other
trifles were strung together by men who commended themselves
to the Kings by relating them, and who found favour with their
contemporaries by committing them to memory and by reciting
them. Of such fashion<a id='r133' href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a> is the fashion of the books which have
come down to us translated from the Persian (Fárasiyah), the
Indian (Hindíyah),<a id='r134' href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a> and the Græco-Roman (Rúmíyah)<a id='r135' href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a>: we
have noted the judgment which should be passed upon compositions
of this nature. <em>Such is the book entituled Hazár
Afsánah or The Thousand Tales, which word in Arabic signifies
Khuráfah (<span lang="la">Facetiæ</span>): it is known to the public under the name of
The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night, (Kitab Alf Laylah

<p class='c000'>Von Hammer adds, “quoting chapt. cxvi, of Al-Mas’údi that

about a century after Al-Mas’udi had mentioned the Hazár
Afsánah, it was versified and probably remodelled by one “Rásti,”
the Takhallus or <span lang="fr">nom de plume</span> of a bard at the Court of

<p class='c000'>Von Hammer some twelve years afterwards (Journ. Asiat.
August, 1839) brought forward, in his “<span lang="fr">Note sur l’origine Persane
des Mille et une Nuits</span>,” a second and an even more important
witness: this was the famous Kitab al-Fihrist,<a id='r142' href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a> or Index List of
(Arabic) works, written (in A.H. 387 = 987) by Mohammed bin
Is’hák al-Nadím (cup-companion or equerry), “popularly known
as Ebou Yacoub el-Werrek.”<a id='r143' href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> The following is an extract (p. <a href='#Page_304'>304</a>)
from the Eighth Discourse which consists of three arts (funún).<a id='r144' href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a>
“The first section on the history of the <span lang="la">confabulatores nocturni</span>
(tellers of night tales) and the relaters of fanciful adventures,
together with the names of books treating upon such subjects.
Mohammed ibn Is’hák saith:—The first who indited themes of
imagination and made books of them, consigning these works to
the libraries, and who ordered some of them as though related by
the tongues of brute beasts, were the palæo-Persians (and the
Kings of the First Dynasty). The Ashkanian Kings of the Third
Dynasty appended others to them and they were augmented and
amplified in the days of the Sassanides” (the fourth and last
royal house). “The Arabs also translated them into Arabic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and the loquent and eloquent polished and embellished them and
wrote others resembling them. The first work of such kind was
entituled ‘The Book of Hazár Afsán,’ signifying Alf Khuráfah,
the argument whereof was as follows. A King of their Kings was
wont, when he wedded a woman and had lain one night with
her, to slay her on the next morning. Presently he espoused a
damsel of the daughters of the Kings, Shahrázád<a id='r145' href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a> hight, one
endowed with intellect and erudition and, whenas she lay with
him, she fell to telling him tales of fancy; moreover she used to
connect the story at the end of the night with that which might
induce the King to preserve her alive and to ask her of its
ending on the next night until a thousand nights had passed over
her. Meanwhile he cohabited with her till she was blest by boon
of child of him, when she acquainted him with the device she
had wrought upon him; wherefore he admired her intelligence and
inclined to her and preserved her life. That King had also a
Kahramánah (nurse and duenna, not <i><span lang="fr">entremetteuse</span></i>), hight
Dínárzád (Dunyázád?), who aided the wife in this (artifice). It is
also said that this book was composed for (or, by) Humái
daughter of Bahman<a id='r146' href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a> and in it were included other matters.
Mohammed bin Is’hak adds:—And the truth is, Inshallah,<a id='r147' href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a> that
the first who solaced himself with hearing night-tales was Al-Iskandar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>(he of Macedon) and he had a number of men who
used to relate to him imaginary stories and provoke him to
laughter: he, however, designed not therein merely to please
himself, but that he might thereby become the more cautious and
alert. After him the Kings in like fashion made use of the book
entitled ‘Hazár Afsán.’ It containeth a thousand nights, but less
than two hundred night-stories, for a single history often occupied
several nights. I have seen it complete sundry times; and it is,
in truth, a corrupted book of cold tales.”<a id='r148' href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A writer in <cite>The Athenæum</cite>,<a id='r149' href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> objecting to Lane’s modern date
for The Nights, adduces evidence to prove the greater antiquity of
the work. (Abu al-Hasan) Ibn Sa’id (bin Musa al-Gharnáti = of
Granada) born in A.H. 615 = 1218 and ob. Tunis A.H. 685 =
1286, left his native city and arrived at Cairo in A.H. 639 = 1241.
This Spanish poet and historian wrote Al-Muhallá bi al-Ash’ár
(The Adorned with Verses), a Topography of Egypt and Africa,
which is apparently now lost. In this he quotes from Al-Kurtubi,
the Cordovan;<a id='r150' href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and he in his turn is quoted by the Arab historian
of Spain, Abú al-Abbás Ahmad bin Mohammed al-Makkári, in
the “Windwafts of Perfume from the Branches of Andalusia the
Blooming”<a id='r151' href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> (A.D. 1628–29). Mr. Payne (x. 301) thus translates
from Dr. Dozy’s published text.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ibn Said (may God have mercy upon him!) sets forth in
his book, El Muhella bi-s-Shaar, quoting from El Curtubi the
story of the building of the Houdej in the Garden of Cairo, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>which was of the magnificent pleasaunces of the Fatimite Khalifs,
the rare of ordinance and surpassing, to wit that the Khalif El
Aamir bi-ahkam-illah<a id='r152' href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a> let build it for a Bedouin woman, the love
of whom had gotten the mastery of him, in the neighbourhood of
the ‘Chosen Garden’<a id='r153' href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a> and used to resort often thereto and was
slain as he went thither; and it ceased not to be a pleasuring-place
for the Khalifs after him. The folk abound in stories of the
Bedouin girl and Ibn Meyyah<a id='r154' href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a> of the sons of her uncle (cousin?)
and what hangs thereby of the mention of El-Aamir, so that the
tales told of them on this account became like unto the story
of El Bettál<a id='r155' href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a> and the <cite>Thousand Nights and a Night</cite> and what
resembleth them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The same passage from Ibn Sa’id, corresponding in three MSS.,
occurs in the famous Khitat<a id='r156' href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a> attributed to Al-Makrizi (ob. A.D.
1444) and was thus translated from a MS. in the British Museum
by Mr. John Payne (ix. 303).</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Khalif El-Aamir bi-ahkam-illah set apart, in the neighbourhood
of the Chosen Garden, a place for his beloved the
Bedouin maid (Aaliyah)<a id='r157' href='#f157' class='c016'><sup>[157]</sup></a> which he named El Houdej. Quoth
Ibn Said, in the book El-Muhella bi-l-ashar, from the History
of El Curtubi, concerning the traditions of the folk of the story
of the Bedouin maid and Ibn Menah (Meyyah) of the sons of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>her uncle and what hangs thereby of the mention of the
Khalif El Aamír bi-ahkam-illah, so that their traditions (or
tales) upon the garden became like unto El Bettál<a id='r158' href='#f158' class='c016'><sup>[158]</sup></a> and the
<cite>Thousand Nights</cite> and what resembleth them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This evidently means either that The Nights existed in the
days of Al-’Ámir (xiith cent.) or that the author compared
them with a work popular in his own age. Mr. Payne attaches
much importance to the discrepancy of titles, which appears
to me a minor detail. The change of names is easily explained.
Amongst the Arabs, as amongst the wild Irish, there is divinity
(the proverb says luck) in odd numbers and consequently the
others are inauspicious. Hence as Sir Wm. Ouseley says
(Travels ii. 21), the number Thousand and One is a favourite in
the East (Olivier, Voyages vi. 385, Paris 1807), and quotes the
Cistern of the “Thousand and One Columns” at Constantinople.
Kæmpfer (Amœn, Exot. p. 38) notes of the Takiyahs
or Dervishes’ convents and the Mazárs or Santons’ tombs near
Koníah (Iconium), “<span lang="la">Multa seges sepulchralium quæ virorum ex
omni ævo doctissimorum exuvias condunt, mille et unum recenset
auctor Libri qui inscribitur Hassaaer we jek mesaar (Hazár ve
yek Mezár), <i>i.e.</i>, mille et unum mausolea</span>.” A book, The Hazar
o yek Rúz (= 1001 Days), was composed in the mid-xviith
century by the famous Dervaysh Mukhlis, Chief Sofi of Isfahan:
it was translated into French by Petis de la Croix, with a
preface by Cazotte, and was Englished by Ambrose Phillips.
Lastly, in India and throughout Asia where Indian influence
extends, the number of cyphers not followed by a significant
number is indefinite: for instance, to determine hundreds the
Hindus affix the required figure to the end and for 100 write
101; for 1000, 1001. But the grand fact of the Hazár Afsánah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is its being the archetype of The Nights, unquestionably proving
that the Arab work borrows from the Persian bodily its cadre
or frame-work, the principal characteristic; its exordium and its
dénoûement, whilst the two heroines still bear the old Persic
names.</p>

<p class='c000'>Baron Silvestre de Sacy<a id='r159' href='#f159' class='c016'><sup>[159]</sup></a>—<span lang="la">clarum et venerabile nomen</span>—is
the chief authority for the Arab provenance of The Nights.
Apparently founding his observations upon Galland,<a id='r160' href='#f160' class='c016'><sup>[160]</sup></a> he is of
opinion that the work, as now known, was originally composed in
Syria<a id='r161' href='#f161' class='c016'><sup>[161]</sup></a> and written in the vulgar dialect; that it was never completed
by the author, whether he was prevented by death or by other
cause; and that imitators endeavoured to finish the work by
inserting romances which were already known but which formed
no part of the original recueil, such as the Travels of Sindbad the
Seaman, the Book of the Seven Wazirs and others. He accepts
the Persian scheme and cadre of the work, but no more. He
contends that no considerable body of præ-Mohammedan or non-Arabic
fiction appears in the actual texts<a id='r162' href='#f162' class='c016'><sup>[162]</sup></a>; and that all the
tales, even those dealing with events localised in Persia, India,
China and other infidel lands and dated from ante-islamitic ages,
mostly with the naïvest anachronism, confine themselves to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>depicting the people, manners and customs of Baghdad and
Mosul, Damascus and Cairo, during the Abbaside epoch; and
he makes a point of the whole being impregnated with the
strongest and most zealous spirit of Mohammedanism. He
points out that the language is the popular or vulgar dialect,
differing widely from the classical and literary; that it contains
many words in common modern use and that generally it suggests
the decadence of Arabian literature. Of one tale he remarks:—The
History of the loves of Camaralzaman and Budour, Princess
of China, is no more Indian or Persian than the others. The
prince’s father has Moslems for subjects, his mother is named
Fatimah and when imprisoned he solaces himself with reading
the Koran. The Genii who interpose in these adventures are,
again, those who had dealings with Solomon. In fine, all that
we here find of the City of the Magians, as well as of the fire-worshippers,
suffices to show that one should not expect to
discover in it anything save the production of a Moslem writer.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this, with due deference to so high an authority, is very
superficial. Granted, which nobody denies, that the archetypal
Hazár Afsánah was translated from Persic into Arabic nearly
a thousand years ago, it had ample time and verge enough to
assume another and a foreign dress, the corpus however remaining
untouched. Under the hands of a host of editors, scribes
and copyists, who have no scruples anent changing words, names
and dates, abridging descriptions and attaching their own decorations,
the florid and rhetorical Persian would readily be converted
into the straight-forward, business-like, matter of fact Arabic.
And what easier than to islamise the old Zoroasterism, to
transform Ahrimán into Iblís the Shaytán, Ján bin Ján into
Father Adam, and the Divs and Peris of Kayomars and the
olden Guebre Kings into the Jinns and Jinniyahs of Sulayman?
Volumes are spoken by the fact that the Arab adapter did not
venture to change the Persic names of the two heroines and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the royal brothers or to transfer the mise-en-scène any whither
from Khorasan or outer Persia. Where the story has not been
too much worked by the literato’s pen, for instance the “Ten
Wazirs” (in the Bresl. Edit. vi. 191–343) which is the Guebre
Bakhtiyár-námah, the names and incidents are old Iranian and
with few exceptions distinctly Persian. And at times we can
detect the process of transition, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> when the Mázin of Khorásán<a id='r163' href='#f163' class='c016'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
of the Wortley Montagu MS. becomes the Hasan of Bassorah
of the Turner Macan MS. (Mac. Edit.).</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently the learned Baron had not studied such works as
the Totá-kaháni or Parrot-chat which, notably translated by
Nakhshabi from the Sanskrit Suka-Saptati,<a id='r164' href='#f164' class='c016'><sup>[164]</sup></a> has now become
as orthodoxically Moslem as The Nights. The old Hindu
Rajah becomes Ahmad Sultan of Balkh, the Prince is Maymún
and his wife Khujisteh. Another instance of such radical
change is the later Syriac version of Kalílah wa Dimnah,<a id='r165' href='#f165' class='c016'><sup>[165]</sup></a> old
“Pilpay” converted to Christianity. We find precisely the same
process in European folk-lore; for instance the <span lang="la">Gesta Romanorum</span>
in which, after five hundred years, the life, manners and customs
of the Romans lapse into the knightly and chivalrous, the
Christian and ecclesiastical developments of mediæval Europe.
Here, therefore, I hold that the Austrian Arabist has proved
his point whilst the Frenchman has failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lane, during his three years’ labour of translation, first
accepted Von Hammer’s view and then came round to that of
De Sacy; differing, however, in minor details, especially in the
native country of The Nights. Syria had been chosen because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>then the most familiar to Europeans: the “Wife of Bath” had
made three pilgrimages to Jerusalem; but few cared to visit
the barbarous and dangerous Nile-Valley. Mr. Lane, however,
was an enthusiast for Egypt or rather for Cairo, the only part
of it he knew; and, when he pronounces The Nights to be of
purely “Arab,” that is, of Nilotic origin, his opinion is entitled to
no more deference than his deriving the sub-African and negroid
Fellah from Arabia, the land <span lang="la">per excellentiam</span> of pure and noble
blood. Other authors have wandered still further afield. Some
finding Mosul idioms in the Recueil, propose “Middlegates” for
its birth-place and Mr. W. G. P. Palgrave boldly says “The
original of this entertaining work appears to have been composed
in Baghdad about the eleventh century; another less
popular but very spirited version is probably of Tunisian authorship
and somewhat later.”<a id='r166' href='#f166' class='c016'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>B.—<span class='sc'>The Date.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The next point to consider is the date of The Nights in its
present form; and here opinions range between the tenth and
the sixteenth centuries. Professor Galland began by placing it
arbitrarily in the middle of the thirteenth. De Sacy, who
abstained from detailing reasons and who, forgetting the number
of editors and scribes through whose hands it must have
passed, argued only from the nature of the language and the
peculiarities of style, proposed <span lang="fr">le milieu du neuvième siècle de
l’hégire</span> (= A.D. 1445–6) as its latest date. Mr. Hole, who
knew The Nights only through Galland’s version, had already
advocated in his “Remarks” the close of the fifteenth century;
and M. Caussin (de Perceval), upon the authority of a supposed note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in Galland’s MS.<a id='r167' href='#f167' class='c016'><sup>[167]</sup></a> (vol. iii. fol. 20, verso), declares the compiler
to have been living in A.D. 1548 and 1565. Mr. Lane says
“Not begun earlier than the last fourth of the fifteenth
century nor ended before the first fourth of the sixteenth,”
<i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> soon after Egypt was conquered by Selim, Sultan of
the Osmanli Turks in A.D. 1517. Lastly the learned Dr.
Weil says in his far too scanty Vorwort (p. ix. 2nd Edit.):—“<span lang="de">Das
wahrscheinlichste dürfte also sein, das im 15. Jahrhundert
ein Egyptier nach altern Vorbilde Erzählungen für 1001 Nächte
theils erdichtete, theils nach mündlichen Sagen, oder frühern
schriftlichen Aufzeichnungen, bearbeitete, dass er aber entweder
sein Werk nicht vollendete, oder dass ein Theil desselben verloren
ging, so dass das Fehlende von Andern bis ins 16. Jahrhundert
hinein durch neue Erzählungen ergänzt wurde.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'>But, as justly observed by Mr. Payne, the first step when
enquiring into the original date of The Nights is to determine
the nucleus of the Repertory by a comparison of the four
printed texts and the dozen MSS. which have been collated
by scholars.<a id='r168' href='#f168' class='c016'><sup>[168]</sup></a> This process makes it evident that the tales
common to all are the following thirteen:—</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>13.</dt>
    <dd>Julnár the Sea-born.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>These forty-two tales, occupying one hundred and twenty
Nights, form less than a fifth part of the whole collection which
in the Mac. Edit.<a id='r169' href='#f169' class='c016'><sup>[169]</sup></a> contains a total of two hundred and sixty-four.
Hence Dr. Patrick Russell,<a id='r170' href='#f170' class='c016'><sup>[170]</sup></a> the Natural Historian of Aleppo,<a id='r171' href='#f171' class='c016'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
whose valuable monograph amply deserves study even in this our
day, believed that the original Nights did not outnumber two
hundred, to which subsequent writers added till the total of
a thousand and one was made up. Dr. Jonathan Scott,<a id='r172' href='#f172' class='c016'><sup>[172]</sup></a> who
quotes Russell, “held it highly probable that the tales of the
original Arabian Nights did not run through more than two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>hundred and eighty Nights, if so many.” So this suggestion I
may subjoin, “<span lang="la">habent sua fata libelli</span>.” Galland, who preserves in
his <span lang="fr">Mille et une Nuits</span> only about one fourth of The Nights, ends
them in No. cclxiv<a id='r173' href='#f173' class='c016'><sup>[173]</sup></a> with the seventh voyage of Sindbad: after
that he intentionally omits the dialogue between the sisters and
the reckoning of time, to proceed uninterruptedly with the tales.
And so his imitator, Petis de la Croix,<a id='r174' href='#f174' class='c016'><sup>[174]</sup></a> in his <span lang="fr">Mille et un Jours</span>,
reduces the thousand to two hundred and thirty-two.</p>

<p class='c000'>The internal chronological evidence offered by the Collection is
useful only in enabling us to determine that the tales were not
written <em>after</em> a certain epoch: the actual dates and, consequently,
all deductions from them, are vitiated by the habits of the scribes.
For instance we find the Tale of the Fisherman and the Jinni
(vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_41">41</a>) placed in A.H. 169 = A.D. 785,<a id='r175' href='#f175' class='c016'><sup>[175]</sup></a> which is hardly
possible. The immortal Barber in the “Tailor’s Tale” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_304">304</a>)
places his adventure with the unfortunate lover on Safar 10,
A.H. 653 (= March 25th, 1255) and 7,320 years of the era of
Alexander.<a id='r176' href='#f176' class='c016'><sup>[176]</sup></a> This is supported in his Tale of Himself (vol. i.
pp. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_317">317</a>–348), where he dates his banishment from Baghdad
during the reign of the penultimate Abbaside, Al-Mustansir
bi ’llah<a id='r177' href='#f177' class='c016'><sup>[177]</sup></a> (A.H. 623–640 = 1225–1242), and his return to Baghdad
after the accession of another Caliph who can be no other but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Al-Muntasim bi ’llah (A.H. 640–656 = A.D. 1242–1258). Again
at the end of the tale (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_350">350</a>) he is described as “an ancient
man, past his ninetieth year” and “a very old man” in the days
of Al-Mustansir (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_318">318</a>); so that the Hunchback’s adventure
can hardly be placed earlier than A.D. 1265 or seven years
after the storming of Baghdad by Huláku Khan, successor of
Janghíz Khan, a terrible catastrophe which resounded throughout
the civilised world. Yet there is no allusion to this crucial
epoch and the total silence suffices to invalidate the date.<a id='r178' href='#f178' class='c016'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
Could we assume it as true, by adding to A.D. 1265 half a century
for the composition of the Hunchback’s story and its incidentals,
we should place the earliest date in A.D. 1315.</p>

<p class='c000'>As little can we learn from inferences which have been drawn
from the body of the book: at most they point to its several
editions or redactions. In the Tale of the “Ensorcelled Prince”
(vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_77">77</a>) Mr. Lane (i. 135) conjectured that the four colours of the
fishes were suggested by the sumptuary laws of the Mameluke
Soldan, Mohammed ibn Kala’un, “subsequently to the commencement
of the eighth century of the Flight, or fourteenth of
our era.” But he forgets that the same distinction of dress was
enforced by the Caliph Omar after the capture of Jerusalem in
A.D. 636; that it was revived by Harun al-Rashid, a contemporary
of Carolus Magnus and that it was noticed as a long standing
grievance by the so-called Mandeville in A.D. 1322. In the
Tale of the Porter and the Ladies of Baghdad the “Sultáni
oranges” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_83">83</a>) have been connected with Sultáníyah city in
Persian Irák, which was founded about the middle of the
thirteenth century: but “Sultáni” may simply mean “royal,”
a superior growth. The same story makes mention (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_94">94</a>) of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Kalandars or religious mendicants, a term popularly corrupted,
even in writing, to Karandal.<a id='r179' href='#f179' class='c016'><sup>[179]</sup></a> Here again “Kalandar” may be
due only to the scribes as the Bresl. Edit, reads Sa’alúk = asker,
beggar. The Khan al-Masrúr in the Nazarene Broker’s story
(i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_265">265</a>) was a ruin during the early ninth century A.H. = A.D.
1420; but the Báb Zuwaylah (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_269">269</a>) dates from A.D. 1087.
In the same tale occurs the Darb al-Munkari (or Munakkari) which
is probably the Darb al-Munkadi of Al-Makrizi’s careful
topography, the Khitat (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_40">40</a>). Here we learn that in his time
(about A.D. 1430) the name had become obsolete, and the
highway was known as Darb al-Amír Baktamír al-Ustaddar from
one of two high officials who both died in the fourteenth century
(circ. A.D. 1350). And lastly we have the Khan al-Jáwali built
about A.D. 1320. In Badr al-Din Hasan (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_237">237</a>) “Sáhib”
is given as a Wazirial title and it dates only from the end of
the fourteenth century.<a id='r180' href='#f180' class='c016'><sup>[180]</sup></a> In Sindbad the Seaman, there is an
allusion (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_67">67</a>) to the great Hindu Kingdom, Vijayanagar
of the Narasimha,<a id='r181' href='#f181' class='c016'><sup>[181]</sup></a> the great power of the Deccan; but this may
be due to editors or scribes as the despotism was founded only in
the fourteenth century (A.D. 1320). The Ebony Horse (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>)
apparently dates before Chaucer; and “The Sleeper and The
Waker” (Bresl. Edit. iv. 134–189) may precede Shakespeare’s
“Taming of the Shrew”: no stress, however, can be laid upon
such resemblances, the nouvelles being world-wide. But when we
come to the last stories, especially to Kamar al-Zaman II. and
the tale of Ma’arúf, we are apparently in the fifteenth and sixteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>centuries. The first contains (Night cmlxxvii.) the word
Láwandiyah = Levantine, the mention of a watch = Sá’ah in
the next Night<a id='r182' href='#f182' class='c016'><sup>[182]</sup></a>; and, further on (cmlxxvi.), the “Shaykh Al-Islam,”
an officer invented by Mohammed II. after the capture
of Stambul in A.D. 1453. In Ma’arúf the ’Ádiliyah is named;
the mosque founded outside the Bab al-Nasr by Al-Malik al-’Ádil,
Túmán Bey in A.H. 906 = A.D. 1501. But, I repeat,
all these names may be mere interpolations.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, a study of the vie intime in Al-Islam and
of the manners and customs of the people proves that the body
of the work, as it now stands, must have been written before
A.D. 1400. The Arabs use wines, ciders and barley-beer, not
distilled spirits; they have no coffee or tobacco and, while
familiar with small-pox (judrí), they ignore syphilis. The
battles in The Nights are fought with bows and javelins,
swords, spears (for infantry) and lances (for cavalry); and,
whenever fire-arms are mentioned, we must suspect the scribe.
Such is the case with the Madfa’ or cannon by means of which
Badr al-Din Hasan breaches the bulwarks of the Lady of Beauty’s
virginity (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_223">223</a>). This consideration would determine the work
to have been written before the fourteenth century. We ignore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the invention-date and the inventor of gunpowder, as of all old
discoveries which have affected mankind at large: all we know
is that the popular ideas betray great ignorance and we are led
to suspect that an explosive compound, having been discovered
in the earliest ages of human society, was utilised by steps so
gradual that history has neglected to trace the series. According
to Demmin<a id='r183' href='#f183' class='c016'><sup>[183]</sup></a>, bullets for stuffing with some incendiary composition,
in fact bombs, were discovered by Dr. Keller in the
Palafites or Crannogs of Switzerland; and the Hindu’s Agni-Astar
(“fire-weapon”), Agni-bán (“fire-arrow”) and Shatagni
(“hundred-killer”), like the Roman Phalarica, and the Greek
fire of Byzantium, suggest explosives. Indeed, Dr. Oppert<a id='r184' href='#f184' class='c016'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
accepts the statement of Flavius Philostratus that when Appolonius
of Tyana, that grand semi-mythical figure, was travelling
in India, he learned the reason why Alexander of Macedon
desisted from attacking the Oxydracæ who live between the
Ganges and the Hyphasis (Satadru or Sutledge):—“These holy
men, beloved by the gods, overthrow their enemies with tempests
and thunderbolts shot from their walls.” Passing over the
Arab sieges of Constantinople (A.D. 668) and Meccah (A.D. 690)
and the disputed passage in Firishtah touching the Tufang or
musket during the reign of Mahmúd the Ghaznevite<a id='r185' href='#f185' class='c016'><sup>[185]</sup></a> (ob.
A.D. 1030), we come to the days of Alphonso the Valiant, whose
long and short guns, used at the Siege of Madrid in A.D. 1084,
are preserved in the Armeria Real. Viardot has noted that the
African Arabs first employed cannon in A.D. 1200, and that the
Maghribis defended Algeciras near Gibraltar with great guns in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>A.D. 1247, and utilised them to besiege Seville in A.D. 1342.
This last feat of arms introduced the cannon into barbarous
Northern Europe, and it must have been known to civilised Asia
for many a decade before that date.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mention of wine in The Nights, especially the Nabíz or
fermented infusion of raisins well known to the præ-Mohammedan
Badawis, perpetually recurs. As a rule, except only in the case
of holy personages and mostly of the Caliph Al-Rashid, the
“service of wine” appears immediately after the hands are
washed; and women, as well as men, drink, like true Orientals,
for the honest purpose of getting drunk—la recherche de l’idéal,
as the process has been called. Yet distillation became well
known in the fourteenth century. Amongst the Greeks and
Romans it was confined to manufacturing aromatic waters, and
Nicander the poet (B.C. 140) used for a still the term <span lang="grc">ἄμβιξ</span>,
like the Irish “pot” and its produce “poteen.” The simple
art of converting salt water into fresh, by boiling the former and
passing the steam through a cooled pipe into a recipient, would
not have escaped the students of the Philosopher’s “stone;” and
thus we find throughout Europe the Arabic modifications of
Greek terms Alchemy, Alembic (Al-<span lang="grc">ἄμβιξ</span>), Chemistry and
Elixir; while “Alcohol” (Al-Kohl), originally meaning “extreme
tenuity or impalpable state of pulverulent substances,” clearly
shows the origin of the article. Avicenna, who died in A.H. 428
= 1036, nearly two hundred years before we read of distillation
in Europe, compared the human body with an alembic, the belly
being the cucurbit and the head the capital:—he forgot one
important difference but <span lang="fr">n’importe</span>. Spirits of wine were first
noticed in the xiiith century, when the Arabs had overrun the
Western Mediterranean, by Arnaldus de Villa Nova, who dubs
the new invention a universal panacea; and his pupil, Raymond
Lully (nat. Majorca A.D. 1236), declared this essence of wine to
be a boon from the Deity. Now The Nights, even in the latest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>adjuncts, never allude to the “white coffee” of the “respectable”
Moslem, the Ráki (raisin-brandy) or Ma-hayát (<i><span lang="la">aqua vitæ</span></i>)
of the modern Mohametan: the drinkers confine themselves to
wine like our contemporary Dalmatians, one of the healthiest
and the most vigorous of seafaring races in Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Syphilis also, which at the end of the xvth century began to
infect Europe, is ignored by The Nights. I do not say it
actually began: diseases do not begin except with the dawn of
humanity; and their history, as far as we know, is simple
enough. They are at first sporadic and comparatively non-lethal:
at certain epochs which we can determine, and for reasons
which as yet we cannot, they break out into epidemics raging
with frightful violence: they then subside into the endemic
state and lastly they return to the milder sporadic form. For
instance, “English cholera” was known of old: in 1831 (Oct. 26)
the Asiatic type took its place and now, after sundry violent
epidemics, the disease is becoming endemic on the Northern
seaboard of the Mediterranean, notably in Spain and Italy. So
small-pox (Al-judrí, vol. i. 254) passed over from Central Africa
to Arabia in the year of Mohammed’s birth (A.D. 570) and thence
overspread the civilised world, as an epidemic, an endemic and
a sporadic successively. The “Greater Pox” has appeared in
human bones of prehistoric graves and Moses seems to mention
gonorrhœa (Levit. xv. 12). Passing over allusions in Juvenal and
Martial,<a id='r186' href='#f186' class='c016'><sup>[186]</sup></a> we find Eusebius relating that Galerius died (A.D. 302) of
ulcers on the genitals and other parts of his body; and, about a
century afterwards, Bishop Palladius records that one Hero, after
conversation with a prostitute, fell a victim to an abscess on the penis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>(phagedænic shanker?). In 1347 the famous Joanna of Naples
founded (æt. 23), in her town of Avignon, a bordel whose inmates
were to be medically inspected—a measure to which England (<span lang="la">proh
pudor</span>!) still objects. In her <span lang="fr">Statuts du Lieu-publique d’Avignon</span>,
No. iv. she expressly mentions the <i><span lang="fr">Mal vengut de paillardise</span></i>.
Such houses, says Ricord who studied the subject since 1832, were
common in France after A.D. 1200; and sporadic venereals were
known there. But in A.D. 1493–94 an epidemic broke out with
alarming intensity at Barcelona, as we learn from the “<span lang="es">Tractado
llamado fructo de todos los Sanctos contra el mal serpentino,
venido de la Isla espanola</span>,” of Rodrigo Ruiz Días, the specialist.
In Santo Domingo the disease was common under the names
Hipas, Guaynaras and Taynastizas: hence the opinion in Europe
that it arose from the mixture of European and “Indian” blood.<a id='r187' href='#f187' class='c016'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
Some attributed it to the Gypsies who migrated to Western
Europe in the xvth century:<a id='r188' href='#f188' class='c016'><sup>[188]</sup></a> others to the Moriscos expelled from
Spain. But the pest got its popular name after the violent outbreak
at Naples in A.D. 1493–4, when Charles VIII. of Anjou with
a large army of mercenaries, Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Germans,
attacked Ferdinand II. Thence it became known as the Mal de
Naples and Morbus Gallicus—<span lang="es">una gallica</span> being still the popular
term in neo-Latin lands—and the “French disease” in England.
As early as July 1496 Marin Sanuto (Journal i. 171) describes
with details the “<span lang="it">Mal Franzoso</span>.” The scientific “syphilis” dates
from Fracastori’s poem (A.D. 1521) in which Syphilus the Shepherd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>is struck like Job, for abusing the sun. After crippling a Pope
(Sixtus IV.<a id='r189' href='#f189' class='c016'><sup>[189]</sup></a>) and killing a King (Francis I.) the <span lang="fr">Grosse Vérole</span>
began to abate its violence, under the effects of mercury it is said;
and became endemic, a stage still shown at Scherlievo near Fiume,
where legend says it was implanted by the Napoleonic soldiery.
The Aleppo and other “buttons” also belong apparently to the
same grade. Elsewhere it settled as a sporadic and now it appears
to be dying out while gonorrhœa is on the increase.<a id='r190' href='#f190' class='c016'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Nights, I have said, belongs to the days before coffee
(A.D. 1550) and tobacco (A.D. 1650) had overspread the East.
The former, which derives its name from the Káfá or Káffá province,
lying south of Abyssinia proper and peopled by the Sidáma Gallas,
was introduced to Mokha of Al-Yaman in A.D. 1429–30 by the
Shaykh al-Sházili who lies buried there, and found a congenial
name in the Arabic Kahwah = old wine.<a id='r191' href='#f191' class='c016'><sup>[191]</sup></a> In The Nights (Mac.
Edit.) it is mentioned twelve times<a id='r192' href='#f192' class='c016'><sup>[192]</sup></a>; but never in the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>tales: except in the case of Kamar al-Zaman II. it evidently does
not belong to the epoch and we may fairly suspect the scribe. In
the xvith century coffee began to take the place of wine in the
nearer East; and it gradually ousted the classical drink from daily
life and from folk-tales.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the same with tobacco, which is mentioned only once by
The Nights (cmxxxi.), in conjunction with meat, vegetables and
fruit and where it is called “Tábah.” Lane (iii. 615) holds it to be
the work of a copyist; but in the same tale of Abu Kir and Abu
Sir, sherbet and coffee appear to have become en vogue, in fact
to have gained the ground they now hold. The result of Lord
Macartney’s Mission to China was a suggestion that smoking might
have originated spontaneously in the Old World.<a id='r193' href='#f193' class='c016'><sup>[193]</sup></a> This is undoubtedly
true. The Bushmen and other wild tribes of Southern
Africa threw their Dakhá (<em>cannabis indica</em>) on the fire and sat
round it inhaling the intoxicating fumes. Smoking without
tobacco was easy enough. The North American Indians of the
Great Red Pipe Stone Quarry and those who lived above the line
where nicotiana grew, used the kinni-kinik or bark of the red
willow and some seven other succedanea.<a id='r194' href='#f194' class='c016'><sup>[194]</sup></a> But tobacco proper,
which soon superseded all materials except hemp and opium, was
first adopted by the Spaniards of Santo Domingo in A.D. 1496
and reached England in 1565. Hence the word, which, amongst
the so-called Red Men, denoted the pipe, the container, not the
contained, spread over the Old World as a generic term with
additions, like “Tutun,”<a id='r195' href='#f195' class='c016'><sup>[195]</sup></a> for especial varieties. The change in
English manners brought about by the cigar after dinner has
already been noticed; and much of the modified sobriety of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>present day may be attributed to the influence of the Holy Herb
en cigarette. Such, we know from history was its effect amongst
Moslems; and the normal wine-parties of The Nights suggest that
the pipe was unknown even when the latest tales were written.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>C.</h4>

<p class='c018'>We know absolutely nothing of the author or authors who
produced our marvellous Recueil. Galland justly observes (Epist.
Dedic.), “probably this great work is not by a single hand; for
how can we suppose that one man alone could own a fancy fertile
enough to invent so many ingenious fictions?” Mr. Lane, and
Mr. Lane alone, opined that the work was written in Egypt by one
person or at most by two, one ending what the other had begun,
and that he or they had re-written the tales and completed the
collection by new matter composed or arranged for the purpose.
It is hard to see how the distinguished Arabist came to such a
conclusion: at most it can be true only of the editors and scribes
of MSS. evidently copied from each other, such as the Mac. and
the Bul. texts. As the Reviewer (Forbes Falconer?) in the
“Asiatic Journal” (vol. xxx., 1839) says, “Every step we have
taken in the collation of these agreeable fictions has confirmed us
in the belief that the work called the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is rather a
vehicle for stories, partly fixed and partly arbitrary, than a collection
fairly deserving, from its constant identity with itself, the
name of a distinct work, and the reputation of having wholly
emanated from the same inventive mind. To say nothing of the
improbability of supposing that one individual, with every license
to build upon the foundation of popular stories, a work which had
once received a definite form from a single writer, would have
been multiplied by the copyist with some regard at least to his
arrangement of words as well as matter. But the various copies
we have seen bear about as much mutual resemblance as if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>had passed through the famous process recommended for disguising
a plagiarism: ‘Translate your English author into French
and again into English.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the style of the several Tales, which will be considered
in a future page (§ iii.), so far from being homogeneous, is heterogeneous
in the extreme. Different nationalities show themselves;
West Africa, Egypt and Syria are all represented and, while some
authors are intimately familiar with Baghdad, Damascus and
Cairo, others are equally ignorant. All copies, written and
printed, absolutely differ in the last tales and a measure of the
divergence can be obtained by comparing the Bresl. Edit. with the
Mac. text: indeed it is my conviction that the MSS. preserved in
Europe would add sundry volumes full of tales to those hitherto
translated; and here the Wortley Montagu copy can be taken as
a test. We may, I believe, safely compare the history of The
Nights with the so-called Homeric poems, the Iliad and the
Odyssey, a collection of immortal ballads and old Epic formulæ
and verses traditionally handed down from rhapsode to rhapsode,
incorporated in a slowly-increasing body of poetry and finally
welded together about the age of Pericles.</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude. From the data above given I hold myself justified
in drawing the following deductions:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The framework of the book is purely Persian perfunctorily
Arabised; the archetype being the Hazár Afsánah.<a id='r196' href='#f196' class='c016'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>2. The oldest tales, such as Sindibad (the Seven Wazirs) and
King Jili’ád, may date from the reign of Al-Mansur, eighth
century A.D.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The thirteen tales mentioned above (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>) as the nucleus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the Repertory, together with “Dalilah the Crafty,”<a id='r197' href='#f197' class='c016'><sup>[197]</sup></a> may be placed
in our tenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The latest tales, notably Kamar al-Zaman the Second and
Ma’aruf the Cobbler, are as late as the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. The work assumed its present form in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. The author is unknown for the best reason; there never was
one: for information touching the editors and copyists we must
await the fortunate discovery of some MSS.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'>§ II.<br > THE NIGHTS IN EUROPE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The history of The Nights in Europe is one of slow and gradual
development. The process was begun (1704–17) by Galland, a
Frenchman, continued (1823) by Von Hammer, an Austro-German,
and finished by Mr. John Payne (1882–84) an Englishman. But we
must not forget that it is wholly and solely to the genius of the
Gaul that Europe owes The “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments”
over which Western childhood and youth have spent so many
spelling hours. Antoine Galland was the first to discover the
marvellous fund of material for the story-teller buried in the
Oriental mine; and he had in a high degree that art of telling a
tale which is far more captivating than culture or scholarship.
Hence his delightful version (or perversion) became one of the
world’s classics and at once made Sheherazade and Dinarzarde,
Haroun Alraschid, the Calendars and a host of other personages
as familiar to the home reader as Prospero, Robinson Crusoe,
Lemuel Gulliver and Dr. Primrose. Without the name and fame
won for the work by the brilliant paraphrase of the learned and
single-minded Frenchman, Lane’s curious hash and latinized
English, at once turgid and emasculated, would have found few
readers. Mr. Payne’s admirable version appeals to the Orientalist
and the “stylist,” not to the many-headed; and mine to the
anthropologist and student of Eastern manners and customs.
Galland did it and alone he did it: his fine literary <i><span lang="fr">flaire</span></i>, his
pleasing style, his polished taste and perfect tact at once made his
work take high rank in the republic of letters nor will the immortal
fragment ever be superseded in the infallible judgment of childhood.
As the Encyclopædia Britannica has been pleased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ignore this excellent man and admirable Orientalist, numismatologist
and littérateur, the reader may not be unwilling to see
a short sketch of his biography.<a id='r198' href='#f198' class='c016'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Antoine Galland was born in A.D. 1646 of peasant parents
“poor and honest” at Rollot, a little <span lang="fr">bourg</span> in Picardy some two
leagues from Montdidier. He was a seventh child and his mother,
left a widow in early life and compelled to earn her livelihood,
saw scant chance of educating him when the kindly assistance of
a Canon of the Cathedral and President of the Collége de Noyon
relieved her difficulties. In this establishment Galland studied
Greek and Hebrew for ten years, after which the “strait thing at
home” apprenticed him to a trade. But he was made for letters;
he hated manual labour and he presently removed <span lang="fr">en cachette</span> to
Paris, where he knew only an ancient kinswoman. She introduced
him to a priestly relative of the Canon of Noyon, who in
turn recommended him to the “<span lang="fr">Sous-principal</span>” of the <span lang="fr">Collége
Du Plessis</span>. Here he made such notable progress in Oriental
studies, that M. Petitpied, a Doctor of the Sorbonne, struck by his
abilities, enabled him to study at the Collége Royal and eventually
to catalogue the Eastern MSS. in the great ecclesiastical
Society. Thence he passed to the Collége Mazarin, where a
Professor, M. Godouin, was making an experiment which might be
revived to advantage in our present schools. He collected a class
of boys, aged about four, and proposed to teach them Latin
speedily and easily by making them converse in the classical
language as well as read and write it.<a id='r199' href='#f199' class='c016'><sup>[199]</sup></a> Galland, his assistant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>had not time to register success or failure before he was appointed
attaché-secretary to M. de Nointel named in 1660 <span lang="fr">Ambassadeur de
France</span> for Constantinople. His special province was to study
the dogmas and doctrines and to obtain official attestations
concerning the articles of the Orthodox (or Greek) Christianity
which had then been a subject of lively discussion amongst certain
Catholics, especially Arnauld (Antoine) and Claude the Minister,
and which even in our day occasionally crops up amongst
“Protestants.”<a id='r200' href='#f200' class='c016'><sup>[200]</sup></a> Galland, by frequenting the <span lang="fr">cafés</span> and listening
to the tale-teller, soon mastered Romaic and grappled with the
religious question, under the tuition of a deposed Patriarch and
of sundry Matráns or Metropolitans, whom the persecutions of the
Pashas had driven for refuge to the Palais de France. M. de Nointel,
after settling certain knotty points in the Capitulations, visited
the harbour-towns of the Levant and the “Holy Places,” including
Jerusalem, where Galland copied epigraphs, sketched monuments
and collected antiques, such as the marbles in the Baudelot
Gallery of which Père Dom Bernard de Montfaucon presently
published specimens in his “<span lang="la">Palæographia Græca</span>,” etc. (Parisiis,
1708).</p>

<p class='c000'>In Syria Galland was unable to buy a copy of The Nights: as he
expressly states in his Epistle Dedicatory, <i><span lang="fr">il a fallu le faire
venir de Syrie</span></i>. But he prepared himself for translating it by
studying the manners and customs, the religion and superstitions
of the people; and in 1675, leaving his chief, who was ordered back
to Stambul, he returned to France. In Paris his numismatic
fame recommended him to MM. Vaillant, Carcary and Giraud
who strongly urged a second visit to the Levant, for the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of collecting, and he set out without delay. In 1691 he made a
third journey, travelling at the expense of the <span lang="fr">Compagnie des
Indes-Orientales</span>, with the main object of making purchases for the
Library and Museum of Colbert the magnificent. The commission
ended eighteen months afterwards with the changes of the
Company, when Colbert and the Marquis de Louvois caused him
to be created “Antiquary to the King,” Louis le Grand, and
charged him with collecting coins and medals for the royal cabinet.
As he was about to leave Smyrna, he had a narrow escape from the
earthquake and subsequent fire which destroyed some fifteen thousand
of the inhabitants: he was buried in the ruins; but, his kitchen
being cold as becomes a philosopher’s, he was dug out unburnt.<a id='r201' href='#f201' class='c016'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Galland again returned to Paris where his familiarity with Arabic
and Hebrew, Persian and Turkish recommended him to MM.
Thevenot and Bignon: this first President of the Grand Council
acknowledged his services by a pension. He also became a
favourite with D’Herbelot whose <span lang="fr">Bibliothèque Orientale</span>, left unfinished
at his death, he had the honour of completing and prefacing.<a id='r202' href='#f202' class='c016'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
President Bignon died within the twelvemonth, which made
Galland attach himself in 1697 to M. Foucault, Councillor of
State and Intendant (governor) of Caen in Lower Normandy,
then famous for its academy: in his new patron’s fine library and
numismatic collection he found materials for a long succession
of works, including a translation of the Koran.<a id='r203' href='#f203' class='c016'><sup>[203]</sup></a> They recommended
him strongly to the literary world and in 1701 he was
made a member of the <span lang="fr">Académie des Inscriptions et Belles
Lettres</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>At Caen Galland issued in 1704,<a id='r204' href='#f204' class='c016'><sup>[204]</sup></a> the first part of his <span lang="fr">Mille et
une Nuits</span>, Contes Arabes traduits en François which at once
became famous as “The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.”
Mutilated, fragmentary and paraphrastic though the tales were,
the glamour of imagination, the marvel of the miracles and the
gorgeousness and magnificence of the scenery at once secured an
exceptional success: it was a revelation in romance, and the public
recognised that it stood in presence of a monumental literary
work. France was a-fire with delight at a something so new, so
unconventional, so entirely without purpose, religious, moral or
philosophical: the Oriental wanderer in his stately robes was a startling
surprise to the easy-going and utterly corrupt Europe of the
<i><span lang="fr">ancien régime</span></i> with its indecently tight garments and perfectly
loose morals. “<span lang="fr">Ils produisirent</span>,” said Charles Nodier, a genius
in his way, “<span lang="fr">dès le moment de leur publication, cet effet qui
assure aux productions de l’esprit une vogue populaire, quoiqu’ils
appartinssent à une littérature peu connue en France; et
que ce genre de composition admît<a id='t99'></a> ou plutôt exigeât des détails
de moeurs, de caractère, de costume et de localités absolument
étrangers à toutes les idées établies dans nos contes et nos romans.
On fut étonné du charme qui résultait de leur lecture. C’est que
la vérité des sentimens, la nouveauté des tableaux, une imagination
féconde en prodiges, un coloris plein de chaleur, l’attrait d’une
sensibilité sans prétention, et le sel d’un comique sans caricature,
c’est que l’esprit et le naturel enfin plaisent partout, et plaisent à
tout le monde.</span>”<a id='r205' href='#f205' class='c016'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Contes Arabes at once made Galland’s name and a popular
tale is told of them and him known to all reviewers who, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>mostly mangle it. In the Biographie Universelle of Michaud<a id='r206' href='#f206' class='c016'><sup>[206]</sup></a> we
find:—<span lang="fr">Dans les deux premiers volumes de ces contes l’exorde était
toujours, “Ma chère sœur, si vous ne dormez pas, faites-nous un
de ces contes que vous savez.” Quelques jeunes gens, ennuyés
de cette plate uniformité, allèrent une nuit qu’il faisait très-grand
froid, frapper à la porte de l’auteur, qui courut en chemise
à sa fenêtre. Après l’avoir fait morfondre quelque temps
par diverses questions insignifiantes<a id='t100'></a>, ils terminèrent en lui disant,
“Ah, Monsieur Galland, si vous ne dormez pas, faites-nous un
de ces beaux contes que vous savez si bien.” Galland profita de
la leçon, et supprima dans les volumes suivants le préambule qui lui
avait attiré la plaisanterie.</span> This legend has the merit of explaining
why the Professor so soon gave up the Arab framework which
he had deliberately adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nights was at once translated from the French<a id='r207' href='#f207' class='c016'><sup>[207]</sup></a> though
when, where and by whom no authority seems to know. In
Lowndes’ “Bibliographer’s Manual” the English Editio Princeps
is thus noticed, “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments translated from
the French, London, 1724, 12mo, 6 vols.” and a footnote states
that this translation, very inaccurate and vulgar in its diction,
was often reprinted. In 1712 Addison introduced into the
Spectator (No. 535, Nov. 13) the Story of Alnaschar (= Al-Nashshár,
the Sawyer) and says that his remarks on Hope
“may serve as a moral to an Arabian tale which I find translated
into French by Monsieur Galland.” His version appears, from the
tone and style, to have been made by himself, and yet in that year
a second English edition had appeared. The nearest approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to the Edit. Princeps in the British Museum<a id='r208' href='#f208' class='c016'><sup>[208]</sup></a> is a set of six volumes
bound in three and corresponding with Galland’s first half dozen.
Tomes i. and ii. are from the fourth edition of 1713, Nos. iii. and
iv. are from the second of 1712 and v. and vi. are from the third
of 1715. It is conjectured that the two first volumes were reprinted
several times apart from their subsequents, as was the fashion of
the day; but all is mystery. We (my friends and I) have turned
over scores of books in the British Museum, the University Library
and the Advocates’ Libraries of Edinburgh and Glasgow: I have
been permitted to put the question in “Notes and Queries” and in
the “Antiquary”; but all our researches hitherto have been in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The popularity of The Nights in England must have rivalled
their vogue in France, judging from the fact that in 1713, or nine
years after Galland’s Edit. Prin. appeared they had already
reached a fourth issue. Even the ignoble national jealousy which
prompted Sir William Jones grossly to abuse that valiant scholar,
Auquetil du Perron, could not mar their popularity. But as there
are men who cannot read Pickwick, so they were not wanting who
spoke of “Dreams of the distempered fancy of the East.”<a id='r209' href='#f209' class='c016'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
“When the work was first published in England,” says Henry
Webber,<a id='r210' href='#f210' class='c016'><sup>[210]</sup></a> “it seems to have made a considerable impression upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the public.” Pope in 1720 sent two volumes (French? or English?)
to Bishop Atterbury, without making any remark on the work;
but, from his very silence, it may be presumed that he was not
displeased with the perusal. The bishop, who does not appear to
have joined a relish for the flights of imagination to his other
estimable qualities, expressed his dislike of these tales pretty
strongly and stated it to be his opinion, formed on the frequent
descriptions of female dress, that they were the work of some
Frenchman (<span lang="fr">Petis de la Croix</span>, a mistake afterwards corrected by
Warburton). The <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, however, quickly made their way
to public favour. “We have been informed of a singular instance of
the effect they produced soon after their first appearance. Sir James
Stewart, Lord Advocate for Scotland, having one Saturday evening
found his daughters employed in reading these volumes,
seized them with a rebuke for spending the evening before the
‘Sawbbath’ in such worldly amusement; but the grave advocate
himself became a prey to the fascination of the tales, being found on
the morning of the Sabbath itself employed in their perusal, from
which he had not risen the whole night.” As late as 1780 Dr.
Beattie professed himself uncertain whether they were translated
or fabricated by M. Galland; and, while Dr. Pusey wrote of them
“<span lang="la">Noctes Mille et Una dictæ, quæ in omnium firmè populorum
cultiorum linguas conversæ, in deliciis omnium habentur, manibusque
omnium terentur</span>,”<a id='r211' href='#f211' class='c016'><sup>[211]</sup></a> the amiable Carlyle, in the gospel according
to Saint Froude, characteristically termed them “downright
lies” and forbade the house to such “unwholesome literature.”
What a sketch of character in two words!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The only fault found in France with the Contes Arabes was that
their style is <i><span lang="fr">peu correcte</span></i>; in fact they want classicism. Yet all
Gallic imitators, Trébutien included, have carefully copied their
leader and Charles Nodier remarks:—“<span lang="fr">Il me semble que l’on n’a pas
rendu assez de justice au style de Galland. Abondant sans être
prolixe, naturel et familier sans être lâche ni trivial, il ne manque
jamais de cette élégance<a id='t103'></a> qui résulte de la facilité, et qui présente
je ne sais quel mélange de la naïveté de Perrault et de la bonhomie
de La Fontaine.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our Professor, with a name now thoroughly established, returned
in 1706 to Paris, where he was an assiduous and efficient
member of the <span lang="fr">Société Numismatique</span> and corresponded largely
with foreign Orientalists. Three years afterwards he was made
Professor of Arabic at the Collége de France, succeeding Pierre
Dippy; and, during the next half decade, he devoted himself to
publishing his valuable studies. Then the end came. In his last
illness, an attack of asthma complicated with pectoral mischief, he
sent to Noyon for his nephew Julien Galland<a id='r212' href='#f212' class='c016'><sup>[212]</sup></a> to assist him in
ordering his MSS. and in making his will after the simplest military
fashion: he bequeathed his writings to the <span lang="fr">Bibliothèque du
Roi</span>, his Numismatic Dictionary to the Academy and his Alcoran
to the Abbé Bignon. He died, aged sixty-nine on February 17,
1715, leaving his second Part of The Nights unpublished.<a id='r213' href='#f213' class='c016'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Galland was a French littérateur of the good old
school which is rapidly becoming extinct. <span lang="fr">Homme vrai dans les
moindres choses</span> (as his Éloge stated); simple in life and manners
and single-hearted in his devotion to letters, he was almost childish
in worldly matters, while notable for penetration and acumen in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>his studies. He would have been as happy, one of his biographers
remarks, in teaching children the elements of education as he was
in acquiring his immense erudition. Briefly, truth and honesty,
exactitude and indefatigable industry characterised his most
honourable career.</p>

<p class='c000'>Galland informs us (Epist. Ded.) that his MS. consisted of four
volumes, only three of which are extant,<a id='r214' href='#f214' class='c016'><sup>[214]</sup></a> bringing the work down
to Night cclxxxii., or about the beginning of “Camaralzaman.”
The missing portion, if it contained like the other volumes 140
pages, would end that tale together with the Stories of Ghánim and
the Enchanted (Ebony) Horse; and such is the disposition in the
Bresl. Edit. which mostly favours in its ordinance the text used by
the first translator. But this would hardly have filled more than
two-thirds of his volumes; for the other third he interpolated, or
is supposed to have interpolated, the ten<a id='r215' href='#f215' class='c016'><sup>[215]</sup></a> following tales.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning these interpolations which contain two of the best
and most widely known stories in the work, Aladdin and the
Forty Thieves, conjectures have been manifold but they mostly
run upon three lines. De Sacy held that they were found by
Galland in the public libraries of Paris. Mr. Chenery, whose
acquaintance with Arabic grammar was ample, suggested that the
Professor had borrowed them from the recitations of the Rawis,
rhapsodists or professional story-tellers in the bazars of Smyrna and
other ports of the Levant. The late Mr. Henry Charles Coote (in
the “Folk-Lore Record,” vol. iii. Part ii. p. 178 <span lang="la">et seq.</span>), “On the
source of some of M. Galland’s Tales,” quotes from popular
Italian, Sicilian and Romaic stories incidents identical with those
in Prince Ahmad, Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Envious Sisters, suggesting
that the Frenchman had heard these <em>paramythia</em> in Levantine
coffee-houses and had inserted them into his unequalled
<i><span lang="la">corpus fabularum</span></i>. Mr. Payne (ix. 268) conjectures the probability
“of their having been composed at a comparatively recent period
by an inhabitant of Baghdad, in imitation of the legends of
Haroun er Rashid and other well-known tales of the original
work;” and adds, “It is possible that an exhaustive examination
of the various MS. copies of the Thousand and One Nights
known to exist in the public libraries of Europe might yet cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>some light upon the question of the origin of the interpolated
Tales.” I quite agree with him, taking “The Sleeper and the
Waker” and “Zeyn Al-asnam” as cases in point; but I should
expect, for reasons before given, to find the stories in a Persic
rather than an Arabic MS. And I feel convinced that all will be
recovered: Galland was not the man to commit a literary forgery.</p>

<p class='c000'>As regards Aladdin, the most popular tale of the whole work, I
am convinced that it is genuine, although my unfortunate friend, the
late Professor Palmer, doubted its being an Eastern story. It is
laid down upon all the lines of Oriental fiction. The mise-en-scène
is China, “where they drink a certain warm liquor” (tea); the
hero’s father is a poor tailor; and, as in “Judar and his Brethren,”
the Maghribi Magician presently makes his appearance, introducing
the Wonderful Lamp and the Magical Ring. Even the
Sorcerer’s cry, “New lamps for old lamps!”—a prime point—is
paralleled in the Tale of the Fisherman’s son,<a id='r218' href='#f218' class='c016'><sup>[218]</sup></a> where the Jew asks
in exchange only old rings and the Princess, recollecting that her
husband kept a shabby, well-worn ring in his writing-stand, and
he being asleep, took it out and sent it to the man. In either tale
the palace is transported to a distance and both end with the
death of the wicked magician and the hero and heroine living
happily together ever after.</p>

<p class='c000'>All Arabists have remarked the sins of omission and commission,
of abridgment, amplification and substitution, and the
audacious distortion of fact and phrase in which Galland freely
indulged, whilst his knowledge of Eastern languages proves that he
knew better. But literary license was the order of his day and at
that time French, always the most <span lang="fr">bégueule</span> of European languages,
was bound by a rigorisme of the narrowest and the straightest of lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>from which the least <span lang="fr">écart</span> condemned a man as a barbarian and a
<i><span lang="fr">tudesque</span></i>. If we consider Galland fairly we shall find that he errs
mostly for a purpose, that of popularising his work; and his success
indeed justified his means. He has been derided (by scholars) for
“<span lang="fr">Hé Monsieur!</span>” and “<span lang="fr">Ah Madame!</span>”; but he could not write
“<span lang="fr">O mon sieur</span>” and “<span lang="fr">O ma dame</span>;” although we can borrow
from biblical and Shakespearean English, “O my lord!” and “O
my lady!” “<span lang="fr">Bon Dieu! ma sœur</span>” (which our translators
english by “O heavens,” Night xx.) is good French for Wa ’lláhi—by
Allah; and “<span lang="fr">cinquante cavaliers bien faits</span>” (“fifty handsome
gentlemen on horseback”) is a more familiar picture
than fifty knights. “<span lang="fr">L’officieuse Dinarzade</span>” (Night lxi.),
and “<span lang="fr">Cette plaisante querelle des deux frères</span>” (Night lxxii.)
become ridiculous only in translation—“the officious Dinarzade”
and “this pleasant quarrel;” while “<span lang="fr">ce qu’il y de remarquable</span>”
(Night lxxiii.) would relieve the Gallic mind from the mortification
of “Destiny decreed.” “<span lang="fr">Plusieurs sortes de fruits et de bouteilles
de vin</span>” (Night ccxxxi. etc.) europeanises flasks and
flaggons; and the violent convulsions in which the girl dies
(Night cliv., her head having been cut off by her sister) is mere
Gallic squeamishness: France laughs at “<span lang="fr">le shoking</span>” in England
but she has only to look at home especially during the reign of
Galland’s contemporary—<span lang="fr">Roi Soleil</span>. The terrible “Old man”
(Shaykh) “of the Sea” (-board) is badly described by “<span lang="fr">l’incommode
vieillard</span>” (“the ill-natured old fellow”): “<span lang="fr">Brave Maimune</span>” and
“<span lang="fr">Agréable Maimune</span>” are hardly what a Jinni would say to a
Jinniyah (ccxiii.); but they are good Gallic. The same may be
noted of “<span lang="fr">Plier les voiles pour marque qu’il se rendait</span>” (Night
ccxxxv.), a European practice; and of the false note struck in two
passages. “<span lang="fr">Je m’estimais heureuse d’avoir fait une si belle
conquête</span>” (Night lxvii.) gives a Parisian turn; and, “<span lang="fr">Je ne puis
voir sans horreur cet abominable barbier que voilà: quoiqu’il soit
né dans un pays où tout le monde est blanc, il ne laisse pas à
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>ressembler<a id='t108'></a> à un Éthiopien; mais il a l’âme encore plus noire et
horrible que le visage</span>” (Night clvii.), is a mere affectation of
Orientalism. Lastly, “<span lang="fr">Une vieille dame de leur connaissance</span>”
(Night clviii.) puts French polish upon the matter of fact Arab’s
“an old woman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The list of absolute mistakes, not including violent liberties,
can hardly be held excessive. Professor Weil and Mr. Payne
(ix. 271) justly charge Galland with making the Trader (Night i.)
throw away the <em>shells</em> (<i><span lang="fr">écorces</span></i>) of the date which has only a pellicle,
as Galland certainly knew; but dates were not seen every day in
France, while almonds and walnuts were of the quatre mendiants.
He preserves the écorces, which later issues have changed to <span lang="fr">noyaux</span>,
probably in allusion to the jerking practice called Inwá. Again in
the “First Shaykh’s Story” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_27">27</a>) the “<span lang="fr">maillet</span>” is mentioned
as the means of slaughtering cattle, because familiar to European
readers: at the end of the tale it becomes “<span lang="fr">le couteau funeste</span>.” In
Badr al-Din a “<span lang="fr">tarte à la crême</span>,” so well known to the West,
displaces, naturally enough, the outlandish “mess of pomegranate-seeds.”
Though the text especially tells us the hero removed his
bag-trousers (not only “son habit”) and placed them under the
pillow, a crucial fact in the history, our Professor sends him to bed
fully dressed, apparently for the purpose of informing his readers
in a footnote that Easterns “<span lang="fr">se couchent en caleçon</span>” (Night
lxxx). It was mere ignorance to confound the <span lang="fr">arbalète</span> or cross-bow
with the stone-bow (Night xxxviii.), but this has universally
been done, even by Lane who ought to have known better; and it
was an unpardonable carelessness or something worse to turn Nár
(fire) and Dún (in lieu of) into “<span lang="fr">le faux dieu Nardoun</span>” (Night lxv.):
as this has been untouched by De Sacy, I cannot but conclude that
he never read the text with the translation. Nearly as bad also
to make the Jewish physician remark, when the youth gave him
the left wrist (Night cl.), “<span lang="fr">voilà une grande ignorance de ne savoir
pas que l’on presente la main droite à un médecin et non pas la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>gauche</span>”—whose exclusive use all travellers in the East must
know. I have noticed the incuriousness which translates “along
the Nile-shore” by “up towards Ethiopia” (Night cli.), and the
“Islands of the <em>Children</em> of Khaledan” (Night ccxi.) instead of
the Khálidatáni or Khálidát, the Fortunate Islands. It was by no
means “<span lang="fr">des petits soufflets</span>” (“some tips from time to time with her
fingers”) which the sprightly dame administered to the Barber’s
second brother (Night clxxi.), but sound and heavy “cuffs” on the
nape; and the sixth brother (Night clxxx.) was not “<span lang="fr">aux lèvres
fendues</span>” (“he of the hair-lips”), for they had been cut off by the
Badawi jealous of his fair wife. Abu al-Hasan would not greet
his beloved by saluting “<span lang="fr">le tapis à ses pieds</span>:” he would kiss her
hands and feet. Haïatalnefous (Hayat al-Nufús, Night ccxxvi.)
would not “throw cold water in the Princess’s face:” she would
sprinkle it with eau-de-rose. “Camaralzaman” I addresses his
two abominable wives in language purely European (ccxxx.), “<span lang="fr">et
de la vie il ne s’approcha d’elles</span>,” missing one of the fine touches
of the tale which shows its hero a weak and violent man, hasty and
lacking the pundonor. “<span lang="fr">La belle Persienne</span>,” in the Tale of Nur
al-Din, was no Persian; nor would her master address her,
“<span lang="fr">Venez çà, impertinente!</span>” (“come hither, impertinence”). In the
story of Badr, one of the Comoro Islands becomes “<span lang="fr">L’île de la
Lune</span>.” “Dog” and “dog-son” are not “<span lang="fr">injures atroces et
indignes d’un grand roi</span>:” the greatest Eastern kings allow
themselves far more energetic and significant language. Fitnah<a id='r219' href='#f219' class='c016'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>is by no means “<span lang="la">Force de cœurs</span>.” Lastly the <i><span lang="fr">dénoûement</span></i> of The
Nights is widely different in French and in Arabic; but that is
probably not Galland’s fault, as he never saw the original, and
indeed he deserves high praise for having invented so pleasant and
sympathetic a close, inferior only to the Oriental device.<a id='r220' href='#f220' class='c016'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Galland’s fragment has a strange effect upon the Orientalist
and those who take the scholastic view, be it wide or narrow.
De Sacy does not hesitate to say that the work owes much to
his fellow-countryman’s hand; but I judge otherwise: it is
necessary to dissociate the two works and to regard Galland’s
paraphrase, which contains only a quarter of The Thousand Nights
and a Night, as a wholly different book. Its attempts to amplify
beauties and to correct or conceal the defects and the grotesqueness
of the original, absolutely suppress much of the local colour,
clothing the bare body in the best of Parisian suits. It ignores
the rhymed prose and excludes the verse, rarely and very rarely
rendering a few lines in a balanced style. It generally rejects the
proverbs, epigrams and moral reflections which form the pith and
marrow of the book; and, worse still, it disdains those finer
touches of character which are often Shakespearean in their depth
and delicacy, and which, applied to a race of familiar ways and
thoughts, manners and customs, would have been the wonder
and delight of Europe. It shows only a single side of the gem
that has so many facets. By deference to public taste it was
compelled to expunge the often repulsive simplicity, the childish
indecencies and the wild orgies of the original, contrasting with
the gorgeous tints, the elevated morality and the religious tone
of passages which crowd upon them. We miss the <span lang="fr">odeur du sang</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>which taints the <span lang="fr">parfums du harem</span>; also the humouristic tale and
the Rabelaisian outbreak which relieve and throw out into strong
relief the splendour of Empire and the havoc of Time. Considered
in this light it is a <span lang="la">caput mortuum</span>, a magnificent texture
seen on the wrong side; and it speaks volumes for the genius of
the man who could recommend it in such blurred and caricatured
condition to readers throughout the civilised world. But those
who look only at Galland’s picture, his effort to “transplant into
European gardens the magic flowers of Eastern fancy,” still
compare his tales with the sudden prospect of magnificent
mountains seen after a long desert-march: they arouse strange
longings and indescribable desires; their marvellous imaginativeness
produces an insensible brightening of mind and an
increase of fancy-power, making one dream that behind them
lies the new and unseen, the strange and unexpected—in fact,
all the glamour of the unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nights has been translated into every far-extending
Eastern tongue, Persian, Turkish and Hindostani. The latter
entitles them Hikáyát al-Jalílah or Noble Tales, and the translation
was made by Munshi Shams al-Din Ahmad for the use
of the College of Fort George in A.H. 1252 = 1836.<a id='r221' href='#f221' class='c016'><sup>[221]</sup></a> All these
versions are direct from the Arabic: my search for a translation
of Galland into any Eastern tongue has hitherto been
fruitless.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was assured by the late Bertholdy Seemann that the
“language of Hoffmann and Heine” contained a literal and
complete translation of The Nights; but personal enquiries at
Leipzig and elsewhere convinced me that the work still remains
to be done. The first attempt to improve upon Galland and to
show the world what the work really is was made by Dr. Max
Habicht and was printed at Breslau (1824–25), in fifteen small square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>volumes.<a id='r222' href='#f222' class='c016'><sup>[222]</sup></a> Thus it appeared before the “Tunis Manuscript”<a id='r223' href='#f223' class='c016'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
of which it purports to be a translation. The German version
is, if possible, more condemnable than the Arabic original. It
lacks every charm of style; it conscientiously shirks every
difficulty; it abounds in the most extraordinary blunders and
it is utterly useless as a picture of manners or a book of reference.
We can explain its <span lang="fr">lâches</span> only by the theory that the eminent
Professor left the labour to his collaborateurs and did not take
the trouble to revise their careless work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next German translation was by Aulic Councillor J. von
Hammer-Purgstall<a id='r224' href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a> who, during his short stay at Cairo and
Constantinople, turned into French the tales neglected by
Galland. After some difference with M. Caussin (de Perceval) in
1810, the Styrian Orientalist entrusted his MS. to Herr Cotta the
publisher of Tubingen. Thus a German version appeared, the
translation of a translation, at the hand of Professor Zinserling,<a href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
while the French version was unaccountably lost en route to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>London. Finally the “Contes inédits,” etc., appeared in a French
translation by G. S. Trébutien (Paris, mdcccxxviii.). Von
Hammer took liberties with the text which can compare only
with those of Lane: he abridged and retrenched till the likeness
in places entirely disappeared; he shirked some difficult passages
and he misexplained others. In fact the work did no honour to
the amiable and laborious historian of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only good German translation of The Nights is due to
Dr. Gustav Weil who, born on April 24, 1808, is still (1886)
professing at Heidelburg.<a id='r225' href='#f225' class='c016'><sup>[225]</sup></a> His originals (he tells us) were the
Breslau Edition, the Bulak text of Abd al-Rahman al-Safati
and a MS. in the library of Saxe Gotha. The venerable savant,
who has rendered such service to Arabism, informs me that Aug.
Lewald’s “Vorhalle” (pp. i.-xv.)<a id='r226' href='#f226' class='c016'><sup>[226]</sup></a> was written without his knowledge.
Dr. Weil neglects the division of days which enables him
to introduce any number of tales: for instance, Galland’s eleven
occupy a large part of vol. iii. The Vorwort wants development;
the notes, confined to a few words, are inadequate and verse is
everywhere rendered by prose, the Saj’a or assonance being wholly
ignored. On the other hand the scholar shows himself by a
correct translation, contrasting strongly with those which preceded
him, and by a strictly literal version, save where the treatment
required to be modified in a book intended for the public. Under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>such circumstances it cannot well be other than longsome and
monotonous reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although Spain and Italy have produced many and remarkable
Orientalists, I cannot find that they have taken the trouble to
translate The Nights for themselves: cheap and gaudy versions
of Galland seem to have satisfied the public.<a id='r227' href='#f227' class='c016'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Notes on the
Romaic, Icelandic, Russian (?) and other versions, will be found in
a future page.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Galland has never been forgotten in France where,
amongst a host of editions, four have claims to distinction;<a id='r228' href='#f228' class='c016'><sup>[228]</sup></a> and
his success did not fail to create a host of imitators and to attract
what De Sacy justly terms “<span lang="fr">une prodigieuse importation de
marchandise de contrebande</span><a id='t114'></a>.” As early as 1823 Von Hammer
numbered seven in France (Trébutien, Préface xviii.) and during
later years they have grown prodigiously. Mr. William F. Kirby,
who has made a special study of the subject, has favoured me
with detailed bibliographical notes on Galland’s imitators which
are printed in Appendix No. II.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>A.—<span class='sc'>The Matter.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Returning to my threefold distribution of this Prose Poem (§ <span class='fss'>I</span>)
into Fable, Fairy Tale and historical Anecdote,<a id='r229' href='#f229' class='c016'><sup>[229]</sup></a> let me proceed
to consider these sections more carefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Apologue or Beast-fable, which apparently antedates all
other subjects in The Nights, has been called “One of the earliest
creations of the awakening consciousness of mankind.” I should
regard it, despite a monumental antiquity, as the offspring of
a comparatively civilised age, when a jealous despotism or a
powerful oligarchy threw difficulties and dangers in the way of
speaking “plain truths.” A hint can be given and a friend or foe
can be lauded or abused as Belins the sheep or Isengrim the wolf,
when the Author is debarred the higher enjoyment of praising
them or dispraising them by name. And, as the purposes of
fables are twofold—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet—</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The speaking of brute beasts would give a piquancy and a
pleasantry to moral design as well as to social and political
satire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The literary origin of the fable is not Buddhistic: we must
especially shun that “Indo-Germanic” school which goes to India
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>for its origins, when Pythagoras, Solon, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle
and possibly Homer sat for instruction at the feet of the Hir-seshtha,
the learned grammarians of the pharaohnic court. Nor was it
Æsopic, evidently Æsop inherited the hoarded wealth of ages. As
Professor Lepsius taught us, “In the olden times within the
memory of man, we know only of <em>one</em> advanced culture; of only
<em>one</em> mode of writing, and of only <em>one</em> literary development, viz.
those of Egypt.” The invention of an alphabet, as opposed to a
syllabary, unknown to Babylonia, to Assyria and to that extreme
bourne of their civilising influences, China, would for ever fix their
literature—poetry, history and criticism,<a id='r230' href='#f230' class='c016'><sup>[230]</sup></a> the apologue and the
anecdote. To mention no others The Lion and the Mouse appears
in a Leyden papyrus dating from B.C. 1200–1166 the days of
Rameses III. (Rhampsinitus) or Hak On, not as a rude and early
attempt, but in a finished form, postulating an ancient origin and
illustrious ancestry. The dialogue also is brought to perfection in
the discourse between the Jackal Koufi and the Ethiopian Cat
(<span lang="fr">Revue Égyptologique ivme. année Part i.</span>). Africa therefore was
the home of the Beast-fable not, as Professor Mahaffy thinks,
because it was the chosen land of animal worship, where</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>but simply because the Nile-land originated every form of literature
between Fabliau and Epos.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Kemi the Black-land it was but a step to Phœnicia,
Judæa,<a id='r232' href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Phrygia and Asia Minor, whence a ferry led over to Greece.
Here the Apologue found its populariser in <span lang="grc">Αἴσωπος</span>, Æsop, whose
name, involved in myth, possibly connects with <span lang="grc">Αἰθίοψ</span>:—“<span lang="la">Æsopus
et Aithiops idem sonant</span>” says the sages. This would
show that the Hellenes preserved a legend of the land whence the
Beast-fable arose, and we may accept the fabulist’s æra as
contemporary with Crœsus and Solon (B.C. 570), about a century
after Psammeticus (Psamethik 1st) threw Egypt open to the restless
Greek.<a id='r233' href='#f233' class='c016'><sup>[233]</sup></a> From Africa too the Fable would in early ages migrate
eastwards and make for itself a new home in the second great
focus of civilisation formed by the Tigris-Euphrates Valley. The
late Mr. George Smith found amongst the cuneiforms fragmentary
Beast-fables, such as dialogues between the Ox and the Horse, the
Eagle and the Sun. In after centuries, when the conquests of
Macedonian Alexander completed what Sesostris and Semiramis
had begun, and mingled the manifold families of mankind by
joining the eastern to the western world, the Orient became
formally hellenised. Under the Seleucidæ and during the life of
the independent Bactrian kingdom (B.C. 255–125), Grecian art
and science, literature and even language overran the old Iranic
reign and extended eastwards throughout northern India. Porus
sent two embassies to Augustus in B.C. 19 and in one of them the
herald Zarmanochagas (Shramanáchárya) of Bargosa, the modern
Baroch in Guzerat, bore an epistle upon vellum written in Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>(Strabo xv. 1 § 78). “<span lang="la">Videtis gentes populosque mutasse sedes</span>”
says Seneca <span lang="la">(De Cons. ad Helv. c. vi.). “Quid sibi volunt in mediis
barbarorum regionibus Græcæ artes? Quid inter Indos Persasque
Macedonicus sermo? Atheniensis in Asia turba est.”</span> Upper
India, in the Macedonian days would have been mainly Buddhistic,
possessing a rude alphabet borrowed from Egypt through Arabia
and Phœnicia, but still in a low and barbarous condition: her
buildings were wooden and she lacked, as far as we know, stone-architecture—the
main test of social development. But the
Bactrian Kingdom gave an impulse to her civilisation and the
result was classical opposed to vedic Sanskrit. From Persia Greek
letters, extending southwards to Arabia, would find indigenous
imitators and there Æsop would be represented by the sundry
sages who share the name Lokman.<a id='r234' href='#f234' class='c016'><sup>[234]</sup></a> One of these was of servile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>condition, tailor, carpenter or shepherd; and a “Habashi”
(Æthiopian) meaning a negro slave with blubber lips and splay
feet, so far showing a superficial likeness to the Æsop of history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Æsopic fable, carried by the Hellenes to India, might have
fallen in with some rude and fantastic barbarian of Buddhistic
“persuasion” and indigenous origin: so Reynard the Fox has its
analogue amongst the Kafirs and the Vái tribe of Mandengan
negroes in Liberia<a id='r235' href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a> amongst whom one Doalu invented or rather
borrowed a syllabarium. The modern Gypsies are said also to
have beast-fables which have never been traced to a foreign
source (Leland). But I cannot accept the refinement of difference
which Professor Benfey, followed by Mr. Keith-Falconer, discovers
between the Æsopic and the Hindu apologue:—“In the former
animals are allowed to act as animals: the latter makes them act
as men in the form of animals.” The essence of the beast-fable
is a reminiscence of <span lang="la">Homo primigenius</span> with erected ears and hairy
hide, and its expression is to make the brother brute behave,
think and talk like him with the superadded experience of ages.
To early man the “lower animals,” which are born, live and die
like himself, showing all the same affects and disaffects, loves and
hates, passions, prepossessions and prejudices, must have seemed
quite human enough and on an equal level to become his substitutes.
The savage, when he began to reflect, would regard the
carnivore and the serpent with awe, wonder and dread; and would
soon suspect the same mysterious potency in the brute as in himself:
so the Malays still look upon the Uran-utan, or Wood-man,
as the possessor of superhuman wisdom. The hunter and the
herdsman, who had few other companions, would presently explain
the peculiar relations of animals to themselves by material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>metamorphosis, the bodily transformation of man to brute giving
increased powers of working him weal and woe. A more advanced
stage would find the step easy to metempsychosis, the beast containing
the Ego (<em>alias</em> soul) of the human: such instinctive belief
explains much in Hindu literature, but it was not wanted at first
by the Apologue.</p>

<p class='c000'>This blending of blood, this racial baptism would produce a
fine robust progeny; and, after our second century, Ægypto-Græco-Indian
stories overran the civilized globe between Rome
and China. Tales have wings and fly farther than the jade
hatchets of proto-historic days. And the result was a book
which has had more readers than any other except the Bible.
Its original is unknown.<a id='r236' href='#f236' class='c016'><sup>[236]</sup></a> The volume, which in Pehlevi became
the Jávidán Khirad (“Wisdom of Ages”) or the Testament
of Hoshang, that ancient guebre King, and in Sanskrit the
Panchatantra (“Five Chapters”), is a recueil of apologues and
anecdotes related by the learned Brahman, Vishnu Sharmá, for
the benefit of his pupils the sons of an Indian Rajah. The Hindu
original has been adapted and translated into a number of languages;
Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac, Greek and Latin, Persian and
Turkish, under a host of names.<a id='r237' href='#f237' class='c016'><sup>[237]</sup></a> Voltaire<a id='r238' href='#f238' class='c016'><sup>[238]</sup></a> wisely remarks of
this venerable production:—<span lang="fr">Quand on fait réflexion que presque
toute la terre a été enfatuée de pareils contes, et qu’ils ont fait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>l’éducation du genre humain, on trouve les fables de Pilpay, de
Lokman,<a id='r239' href='#f239' class='c016'><sup>[239]</sup></a> d’Ésope, bien raisonables</span>. But methinks the sage of
Ferney might have said far more. These fables speak with the large
utterance of early man; they have also their own especial beauty—the
charms of well-preserved and time-honoured old age. There
is in their wisdom a perfume of the past, homely and ancient-fashioned
like a whiff of <i><span lang="fr">pot pourri</span></i>, wondrous soothing withal to
olfactories agitated by the patchoulis and jockey clubs of modern
pretenders and <span lang="fr">petit-maîtres</span>, with their grey young heads and
pert intelligence, the motto of whose ignorance is “<span lang="fr">Connu!</span>” Were
a dose of its antique, mature experience adhibited to the Western
before he visits the East, those few who could digest it might
escape the normal lot of being twisted round the fingers of every
rogue they meet from Dragoman to Rajah. And a quotation from
them tells at once: it shows the quoter to be a man of education,
not a “Jangalí,” a sylvan or savage, as the Anglo-Indian official
is habitually termed by his more civilised “fellow-subject.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The main difference between the classical apologue and the
fable in The Nights is that while Æsop and Gabrias write laconic
tales with a single event and a simple moral, the Arabian fables
are often “long-continued novelle involving a variety of events,
each characterised by some social or political aspect, forming a
narrative highly interesting in itself, often exhibiting the most
exquisite moral, and yet preserving, with rare ingenuity, the
peculiar characteristics of the actors.”<a id='r240' href='#f240' class='c016'><sup>[240]</sup></a> And the distinction
between the ancient and the mediæval apologue, including the
modern which, since “<span lang="de">Reineke Fuchs</span>,” is mainly German, appears
equally pronounced. The latter is humorous enough and rich in
the wit which results from superficial incongruity; but it ignores
the deep underlying bond which connects man with beast. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the main secret of its success is the strain of pungent satire,
especially in the Renardine Cycle, which the people could apply
to all unpopular “lordes and prelates, gostly and worldly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our Recueil contains two distinct sets of apologues.<a id='r241' href='#f241' class='c016'><sup>[241]</sup></a> The
first (vol. iii.) consists of eleven, alternating with five anecdotes
(Nights cxlvi.-cliii.), following the lengthy and knightly
romance of King Omar bin al Nu’man and followed by the
melancholy love tale of Ali bin Bakkár. The second series in
vol. ix., consisting of eight fables, not including ten anecdotes
(Nights cmi.-cmxxiv.), is injected into the romance of King
Jali’ad and Shimas mentioned by Al-Mas’udi as independent
of The Nights. In both places the Beast-fables are introduced
with some art and add variety to the subject-matter,
obviating monotony—the deadly sin of such works—and giving
repose to the hearer or reader after a climax of excitement
such as the murder of the Wazirs. And even these are not
allowed to pall upon the mental palate, being mingled with
anecdotes and short tales, such as the Hermits (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_125">125</a>), with
biographical or literary episodes, acroamata, table-talk and
analects where humorous Rabelaisian anecdote finds a place;
in fact the fabliau or novella. This style of composition may be
as ancient as the apologues. We know that it dates as far back
as Rameses III., from the history of the Two Brothers in the
Orbigny papyrus,<a id='r242' href='#f242' class='c016'><sup>[242]</sup></a> the prototype of Yusuf and Zulaykha, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Koranic Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. It is told with a
charming naïveté and such sharp touches of local colour as,
“Come, let us make merry an hour and lie together! <em>Let down
thy hair!</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the apologues in The Nights are pointless enough,
<span lang="fr">rien moins qu’amusants</span>; but in the best specimens, such as the
Wolf and the Fox<a id='r243' href='#f243' class='c016'><sup>[243]</sup></a> (the wicked man and the wily man), both
characters are carefully kept distinct and neither action nor
dialogue ever flags. Again The Flea and the Mouse (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_151">151</a>), of
a type familiar to students of the Pilpay cycle, must strike the
home-reader as peculiarly quaint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next in date to the Apologue comes the Fairy Tale proper,
where the natural universe is supplemented by one of purely
imaginative existence. “As the active world is inferior to the
rational soul,” says Bacon with his normal sound sense, “so
Fiction gives to Mankind what History denies and in some
measure satisfies the Mind with Shadows when it cannot enjoy
the Substance. And as real History gives us not the success of
things according to the deserts of vice and virtue, Fiction corrects
it and presents us with the fates and fortunes of persons rewarded
and punished according to merit.” But I would say still more.
History paints or attempts to paint life as it is, a mighty maze
with or without a plan: Fiction shows or would show us life as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>should be, wisely ordered and laid down on fixed lines. Thus
Fiction is not the mere handmaid of History: she has a household
of her own and she claims to be the triumph of Art which,
as Goëthe remarked, is “Art because it is not Nature.” Fancy,
<i><span lang="fr">la folle du logis</span></i>, is “that kind and gentle portress who holds the
gate of Hope wide open, in opposition to Reason, the surly and
scrupulous guard.”<a id='r244' href='#f244' class='c016'><sup>[244]</sup></a> As Palmerin of England says and says well,
“For that the report of noble deeds doth urge the courageous
mind to equal those who bear most commendation of their
approved valiancy; this is the fair fruit of Imagination and of
ancient histories.” And, last but not least, the faculty of Fancy
takes count of the cravings of man’s nature for the marvellous,
the impossible, and of his higher aspirations for the Ideal, the
Perfect: she realises the wild dreams and visions of his generous
youth and portrays for him a portion of that “other and better
world,” with whose expectation he would console his age.</p>

<p class='c000'>The imaginative varnish of The Nights serves admirably as a
foil to the absolute realism of the picture in general. We enjoy
being carried away from trivial and common-place characters,
scenes and incidents; from the matter of fact surroundings of a
work-a-day world, a life of eating and drinking, sleeping and
waking, fighting and loving, into a society and a mise-en-scène
which we suspect can exist and which we know does not. Every
man at some turn or term of his life has longed for supernatural
powers and a glimpse of Wonderland. Here he is in the midst
of it. Here he sees mighty spirits summoned to work the human
mite’s will, however whimsical, who can transport him in an eye-twinkling
whithersoever he wishes; who can ruin cities and build
palaces of gold and silver, gems and jacinths; who can serve up
delicate viands and delicious drinks in priceless chargers and impossible
cups and bring the choicest fruits from farthest Orient:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>here he finds <span lang="la">magas</span> and magicians who can make kings of his
friends, slay armies of his foes and bring any number of beloveds
to his arms. And from this outraging probability and outstripping
possibility arises not a little of that strange fascination
exercised for nearly two centuries upon the life and literature of
Europe by The Nights, even in their mutilated and garbled form.
The reader surrenders himself to the spell, feeling almost inclined
to enquire “And why may it not be true?”<a id='r245' href='#f245' class='c016'><sup>[245]</sup></a> His brain is dazed
and dazzled by the splendours which flash before it, by the sudden
procession of Jinns and Jinniyahs, demons and fairies, some
hideous, others preternaturally beautiful; by good wizards and
evil sorcerers, whose powers are unlimited for weal and for woe;
by mermen and mermaids, flying horses, talking animals, and
reasoning elephants; by magic rings and their slaves and by
talismanic couches which rival the carpet of Solomon. Hence,
as one remarks, these Fairy Tales have pleased and still continue
to please almost all ages, all ranks and all different capacities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Hawkesworth<a id='r246' href='#f246' class='c016'><sup>[246]</sup></a> observes that these Fairy Tales find favour
“because even their machinery, wild and wonderful as it is, has
its laws; and the magicians and enchanters perform nothing but
what was naturally to be expected from such beings, after we had
once granted them existence.” Mr. Heron “rather supposes the
very contrary is the truth of the fact. It is surely the strangeness,
the unknown nature, the anomalous character of the supernatural
agents here employed, that makes them to operate so
powerfully on our hopes, fears, curiosities, sympathies, and, in
short, on all the feelings of our hearts. We see men and women,
who possess qualities to recommend them to our favour, subjected
to the influence of beings, whose good or ill will, power or weakness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>attention or neglect, are regulated by motives and circumstances
which we cannot comprehend: and hence, we naturally
tremble for their fate, with the same anxious concern, as we
should for a friend wandering, in a dark night, amidst torrents
and precipices; or preparing to land on a strange island, while he
knew not whether he should be received, on the shore, by cannibals
waiting to tear him piecemeal, and devour him, or by
gentle beings, disposed to cherish him with fond hospitality.”
Both writers have expressed themselves well, but meseems each
has secured, as often happens, a fragment of the truth and holds
it to be the whole Truth. Granted that such spiritual creatures
as Jinns walk the earth, we are pleased to find them so very
human, as wise and as foolish in word and deed as ourselves:
similarly we admire in a landscape natural forms like those of
Staffa or the Palisades which favour the works of architecture.
Again, supposing such preternaturalisms to be around and
amongst us, the wilder and more capricious they prove, the
more our attention is excited and our forecasts are baffled to be
set right in the end. But this is not all. The grand source of
pleasure in Fairy Tales is the natural desire to learn more of the
Wonderland which is known to many as a word and nothing
more, like Central Africa before the last half century: thus the
interest is that of the “Personal Narrative” of a grand exploration
to one who delights in travels. The pleasure must be
greatest where faith is strongest; for instance amongst imaginative
races like the Kelts and especially Orientals, who imbibe
supernaturalism with their mother’s milk. “I am persuaded,”
writes Mr. Bayle St. John,<a id='r247' href='#f247' class='c016'><sup>[247]</sup></a> “that the great scheme of preternatural
energy, so fully developed in The Thousand and One Nights, is
believed in by the majority of the inhabitants of all the religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>professions both in Syria and Egypt.” He might have added
“by every reasoning being from prince to peasant, from Mullah
to Badawi, between Marocco and Outer Ind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fairy Tale in The Nights is wholly and purely Persian.
The gifted Iranian race, physically the noblest and the most
beautiful of all known to me, has exercised upon the world-history
an amount of influence which has not yet been fully
recognised. It repeated for Babylonian art and literature what
Greece had done for Egyptian, whose dominant idea was that of
working for eternity a <span lang="grc">κτῆμα εἰς ἀεί</span>. Hellas and Iran instinctively
chose as their characteristic the idea of Beauty, rejecting
all that was exaggerated and grotesque; and they made the
sphere of Art and Fancy as real as the world of Nature and Fact.
The innovation was hailed by the Hebrews. The so-called
Books of Moses deliberately and ostentatiously ignored the future
state of rewards and punishments, the other world which ruled
the life of the Egyptian in this world: the lawgiver, whoever he
may have been, Osarsiph or Moshe, apparently held the tenet
unworthy of a race whose career he was directing to conquest
and isolation in dominion. But the Jews, removed to Mesopotamia,
the second cradle of the creeds, presently caught the
infection of their Asiatic media; superadded Babylonian legend
to Egyptian myth; stultified The Law by supplementing it with
the “absurdities of foreign fable” and ended, as the Talmud
proves, with becoming the most wildly superstitious and “otherworldly”
of mankind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same change befel Al-Islam. The whole of its supernaturalism
is borrowed bodily from Persia, which had “imparadised
Earth by making it the abode of angels.” Mohammed,
a great and commanding genius, blighted and narrowed by surroundings
and circumstance to something little higher than a
Covenanter or a Puritan, declared to his followers,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am sent to ’stablish the manners and customs;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and his deficiency of imagination made him dislike everything
but “women, perfumes, and prayers,” with an especial aversion
to music and poetry, plastic art and fiction. Yet his system,
unlike that of Moses, demanded thaumaturgy and metaphysical
entities, and these he perforce borrowed from the Jews who had
borrowed them from the Babylonians: his soul and spirit, his
angels and devils, his cosmogony, his heavens and hells, even the
Bridge over the Great Depth are all either Talmudic or Iranian.
But there he stopped and would have stopped others. His
enemies among the Koraysh were in the habit of reciting certain
Persian fabliaux and of extolling them as superior to the silly
and equally fictitious stories of the “Glorious Koran.” The
leader of these scoffers was one Nazr ibn Háris who, taken
prisoner after the Battle of Bedr, was incontinently decapitated,
by apostolic command, for what appears to be a natural and
sensible preference. It was the same furious fanaticism and one-idea’d
intolerance which made Caliph Omar destroy all he could
find of the Alexandrian Library and prescribe burning for the
Holy Books of the Persian Guebres. And the taint still lingers in
Al-Islam: it will be said of a pious man, “He always studies
the Koran, the Traditions and other books of Law and Religion;
and he never reads poems nor listens to music or to stories.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mohammed left a dispensation or rather a reformation so arid,
jejune and material that it promised little more than the “Law
of Moses,” before this was vivified and racially baptised by Mesopotamian
and Persic influences. But human nature was stronger
than the Prophet and, thus outraged, took speedy and absolute
revenge. Before the first century had elapsed, orthodox Al-Islam
was startled by the rise of Tasawwuf or Sufyism<a id='r248' href='#f248' class='c016'><sup>[248]</sup></a> a revival of
classic Platonism and Christian Gnosticism, with a mingling of
modern Hylozoism; which, quickened by the glowing imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of the East, speedily formed itself into a creed the most
poetical and impractical, the most spiritual and the most transcendental
ever invented; satisfying all man’s hunger for “belief”
which, if placed upon a solid basis of fact and proof, would forthright
cease to be belief.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will take from The Nights, as a specimen of the true Persian
romance, “The Queen of the Serpents” (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_298">298</a>), the subject
of Lane’s Carlylean denunciation. The first gorgeous picture is
the Session of the Snakes which, like their Indian congeners the
Nága kings and queens, have human heads and reptile bodies,
an Egyptian myth that engendered the “old serpent” of Genesis.
The Sultánah welcomes Hásib Karím al-Dín, the hapless lad who
had been left in a cavern to die by the greedy woodcutters; and,
in order to tell him her tale, introduces the “Adventures of
Bulúkiyá”: the latter is an Israelite converted by editor and
scribe to Mohammedanism; but we can detect under his assumed
faith the older creed. Solomon is not buried by authentic history
“beyond the Seven (mystic) Seas,” but at Jerusalem or
Tiberias; and his seal-ring suggests the Jám-i-Jam, the crystal
cup of the great King Jamshíd. The descent of the Archangel
Gabriel, so familiar to Al-Islam, is the manifestation of Bahman,
the First Intelligence, the mightiest of the Angels who enabled
Zarathustra-Zoroaster to walk like Bulukiya over the Dálatí or
Caspian Sea.<a id='r249' href='#f249' class='c016'><sup>[249]</sup></a> Amongst the sights shown to Bulukiya, as he
traverses the Seven Oceans, is a battle royal between the believing
and the unbelieving Jinns, true Magian dualism, the eternal
duello of the Two Roots or antagonistic Principles, Good and
Evil, Hormuzd and Ahriman, which Milton has debased into a
common-place modern combat fought also with cannon. Sakhr
the Jinni is Eshem chief of the Divs, and Kaf, the encircling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>mountain, is a later edition of Persian Alborz. So in the Mantak
al-Tayr (Colloquy of the Flyers) the Birds, emblems of souls,
seeking the presence of the gigantic feathered biped Simurgh, their
god, traverse seven Seas (according to others seven Wadys) of
Search, of Love, of Knowledge, of Competence, of Unity, of Stupefaction,
and of Altruism (<i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> annihilation of self), the several stages
of contemplative life. At last, standing upon the mysterious
island of the Simurgh and “casting a clandestine glance at him
they saw thirty birds<a id='r250' href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a> in him; and when they turned their eyes
to themselves the thirty birds seemed one Simurgh: they saw in
themselves the entire Simurgh; they saw in the Simurgh the
thirty birds entirely.” Therefore they arrived at the solution of
the problem “<em>We</em> and <em>Thou</em>;” that is, the identity of God and
Man; they were for ever annihilated in the Simurgh and the
shade vanished in the sun (Ibid. iii. 250). The wild ideas concerning
Khalít and Malít (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_319">319</a>) are again Guebre. “From
the seed of Kayomars (the androgyne, like pre-Adamite man)
sprang a tree shaped like two human beings and thence proceeded
Meshia and Meshianah, first man and woman, progenitors
of mankind;” who, though created for “Shídistán, Lightland,”
were seduced by Ahriman. This “two-man-tree” is evidently
the duality of Physis and Anti-physis, Nature and her
counterpart, the battle between Mihr, Izad or Mithra with his
Surush and Feristeh (Seraphs and Angels) against the Divs who
are the children of Time led by the arch-demon Eshem. Thus
when Hormuzd created the planets, the dog, and all useful
animals and plants, Ahriman produced the comets, the wolf,
noxious beasts and poisonous growths. The Hindus represent
the same metaphysical idea by Bramhá the Creator and Visvakarma,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the Anti-creator,<a id='r251' href='#f251' class='c016'><sup>[251]</sup></a> miscalled by Europeans Vulcan: the
former fashions a horse and a bull and the latter caricatures them
with an ass and a buffalo,—evolution turned topsy turvy. After
seeing nine angels and obtaining an explanation of the Seven
Stages of Earth which is supported by the Gav-i-Zamín, the
energy, symbolised by a bull, implanted by the Creator in the
mundane sphere, Bulukiya meets the four Archangels, to wit
Gabriel who is the Persian Rawánbakhsh or Life-giver; Michael
or Beshter, Raphael or Israfil alias Ardibihisht, and Azazel or
Azrail who is Dumá or Mordad, the Death-giver; and the four
are about to attack the Dragon, that is, the demons hostile to
mankind who were driven behind Alborz-Kaf by Tahmuras the
ancient Persian king. Bulukiya then recites an episode within an
episode, the “Story of Jánsháh,” itself a Persian name and
accompanied by two others (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_329">329</a>), the <i><span lang="fr">mise-en-scène</span></i> being
Kabul and the King of Khorasan appearing in the proem.
Janshah, the young Prince, no sooner comes to man’s estate than
he loses himself out hunting and falls in with cannibals whose
bodies divide longitudinally, each moiety going its own way:
these are the Shikk (split ones) which the Arabs borrowed from
the Persian Ním-chihrah or Half-faces. They escape to the
Ape-island whose denizens are human in intelligence and speak
articulately, as the universal East believes they can: these Simiads
are at chronic war with the Ants, alluding to some obscure
myth which gave rise to the gold-diggers of Herodotus and other
classics, “emmets in size somewhat less than dogs but bigger than
foxes.”<a id='r252' href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a> The episode then falls into the banalities of Oriental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>folk-lore. Janshah, passing the Sabbation river and reaching the
Jews’ city, is persuaded to be sewn up in a skin and is carried in
the normal way to the top of the Mountain of Gems where he
makes acquaintance with Shaykh Nasr, Lord of the Birds: he
enters the usual forbidden room; falls in love with the pattern
Swan-maiden; wins her by the popular process; loses her and
recovers her through the Monk Yaghmús, whose name, like that
of King Teghmús, is a burlesque of the Greek; and, finally, when
she is killed by a shark, determines to mourn her loss till the end
of his days. Having heard this story Bulukiya quits him; and,
resolving to regain his natal land, falls in with Khizr; and the
Green Prophet, who was Wazir to Kay Kobad (vith century B.C.)
and was connected with Macedonian Alexander (!) enables him
to win his wish. The rest of the tale calls for no comment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly and lastly we have the histories, historical stories and the
“Ana” of great men in which Easterns as well as Westerns
delight: the gravest writers do not disdain to relieve the dullness
of chronicles and annals by means of such discussions, humorous
or pathetic, moral or grossly indecent. The dates must greatly
vary: some of the anecdotes relating to the early Caliphs appear
almost contemporary; others, like Ali of Cairo and Abu al-Shamat,
may be as late as the Ottoman Conquest of Egypt (sixteenth
century). All are distinctly Sunnite and show fierce animus
against the Shi’ah heretics, suggesting that they were written after
the destruction of the Fatimite dynasty (twelfth century) by Salah
al-Din (Saladin the Kurd) one of the latest historical personages
and the last king named in The Nights.<a id='r253' href='#f253' class='c016'><sup>[253]</sup></a> These anecdotes are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>often connected with what a learned Frenchman terms the
“<span lang="fr">regne féerique de Haroun er-Réschid</span>,”<a id='r254' href='#f254' class='c016'><sup>[254]</sup></a> that the Great Caliph
becomes the hero of this portion of The Nights. Aaron the
Orthodox was the central figure of the most splendid empire the
world had seen, the Viceregent of Allah combining the powers of
Cæsar and Pope, and wielding them right worthily according to
the general voice of historians. To quote a few: Ali bin Talib
al-Khorásáni described him, in A.D. 934, a century and-a-half
after his death when flattery would be tongue-tied, as, “one
devoted to war and pilgrimage, whose bounty embraced the folk
at large.” Sa’adi (ob. A.D. 1291) tells a tale highly favourable
to him in the “Gulistan” (lib. i. 36). Fakhr al-Din<a id='r255' href='#f255' class='c016'><sup>[255]</sup></a> (xivth
century) lauds his merits, eloquence, science and generosity;
and Al-Siyuti (nat. A.D. 1445) asserts “He was one of
the most distinguished of Caliphs and the most illustrious
of the Princes of the Earth” (p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>). The Shaykh al-Nafzáwi<a id='r256' href='#f256' class='c016'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
(sixteenth century) in his Rauz al-’Átir fí Nazáh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>al-Khátir = Scented Garden-site for Heart-delight, calls Harun
(chapt. vii.) the “Master of munificence and bounty, the best
of the generous.” And even the latest writers have not ceased
to praise him. Says Alí Azíz Efendi the Cretan, in the Story of
Jewád<a id='r257' href='#f257' class='c016'><sup>[257]</sup></a> (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), “Harun was the most bounteous, illustrious and
upright of the Abbaside Caliphs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifth Abbaside was fair and handsome, of noble and majestic
presence, a sportsman and an athlete who delighted in polo and
archery. He showed sound sense and true wisdom in his speech
to the grammarian-poet Al-Asma’í, who had undertaken to teach
him:—“<span lang="fr">Ne m’enseignez jamais en public, et ne vous empressez
pas trop de me donner des avis en particulier. Attendez ordinairement
que je vous interroge, et contentez-vous de me donner
une response précise à ce que je vous demanderai, sans y rien
ajouter de superflu. Gardez vous surtout de vouloir me
préoccuper pour vous attirer ma créance, et pour vous donner de
l’autorité. Ne vous étendez<a id='t134'></a> jamais trop en long sur les histoires
et les traditions que vous me raconterez, si je ne vous en donne la
permission. Lorsque vous verrai que je m’eloignerai de l’équité dans
mes jugements, ramenez-moi avec douceur, sans user de paroles
fâcheuses ni de réprimandes. Enseignez-moi principalement les
choses qui sont les plus nécessaires pour les discours que je dois
faire en public, dans les mosquées et ailleurs; et ne parlez point
en termes obscurs, ou mystérieux, ni avec des paroles trop
recherchées.</span>”<a id='r258' href='#f258' class='c016'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He became well read in science and letters, especially history
and tradition, for “his understanding was as the understanding of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the learned;” and, like all educated Arabs of his day, “he was a
connoisseur of poetry which at times he improvised with success.”<a id='r259' href='#f259' class='c016'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
He made the pilgrimage every alternate year and sometimes on foot,
while “his military expeditions almost equalled his pilgrimages.”
Day after day during his Caliphate he prayed a hundred “bows,”
never neglecting them, save for some especial reason, till his
death; and he used to give from his privy purse alms to the
extent of a hundred dirhams per diem. He delighted in panegyry
and liberally rewarded its experts, one of whom, Abd al-Sammák
the Preacher, fairly said of him, “Thy humility in thy
greatness is nobler than thy greatness.” “No Caliph,” says
Al-Niftawayh, “had been so profusely liberal to poets, lawyers
and divines, although as the years advanced he wept over his
extravagance amongst other sins.” There was vigorous manliness
in his answer to the Grecian Emperor who had sent him an insulting
missive:—“In the name of Allah! From the Commander of
the Faithful Harun al-Rashid, to Nicephorus the Roman dog. I
have read thy writ, O son of a miscreant mother! Thou shalt
not hear, thou shalt see my reply.” Nor did he cease to make the
Byzantine feel the weight of his arm till he “nakh’d”<a id='r260' href='#f260' class='c016'><sup>[260]</sup></a> his camel
in the imperial Court-yard; and this was only one instance of his
indomitable energy and hatred of the Infidel. Yet, if the West is
to be believed, he forgot his fanaticism in his diplomatic dealings
and courteous intercourse with Carolus Magnus.<a id='r261' href='#f261' class='c016'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Finally, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>civilised and well regulated rule contrasted as strongly with the
barbarity and turbulence of occidental Christendom, as the
splendid Court and the luxurious life of Baghdad and its carpets
and hangings devanced the quasi-savagery of London and Paris
whose palatial halls were spread with rushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great Caliph ruled twenty-three years and a few months
(A.H. 170–193 = A.D. 786–808); and, as his youth was chequered
and his reign was glorious, so was his end obscure.<a id='r262' href='#f262' class='c016'><sup>[262]</sup></a> After a
vision foreshadowing his death,<a id='r263' href='#f263' class='c016'><sup>[263]</sup></a> which happened, as becomes a
good Moslem, during a military expedition to Khorasan, he
ordered his grave to be dug and himself to be carried to it in a
covered litter: when sighting the fosse he exclaimed, “O son of
man thou art come to this!” Then he commanded himself to be
set down and a perlection of the Koran to be made over him in
the litter on the edge of the grave. He was buried (æt. forty-five)
at Sanábád, a village near Tús.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aaron the Orthodox appears in The Nights as a headstrong
and violent autocrat, a right royal figure according to the Moslem
ideas of his day. But his career shows that he was not more
tyrannical or more sanguinary than the normal despot of the East,
or the contemporary Kings of the West: in most points, indeed,
he was far superior to the historic misrulers who have afflicted the
world from Spain to furthest China. But a single great crime, a
tragedy whose details are almost incredibly horrible, marks his
reign with the stain of infamy, with a blot of blood never to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>washed away. This tale, “full of the waters of the eye,” as
Firdausi sings, is the massacre of the Barmecides; a story which
has often been told and which cannot here be passed over in silence.
The ancient and noble Iranian house, belonging to the “Ebná”
or Arabised Persians, had long served the Ommiades till, early
in our eighth century, Khálid bin Bermek,<a id='r264' href='#f264' class='c016'><sup>[264]</sup></a> the chief, entered the
service of the first Abbaside and became Wazir and Intendant of
Finance to Al-Saffah. The most remarkable and distinguished of
the family, he was in office when Al-Mansur transferred the capital
from Damascus, the head-quarters of the hated Ommiades, to
Baghdad, built ad hoc. After securing the highest character in
history by his personal gifts and public services, he was succeeded
by his son and heir Yáhyá (John), a statesman famed from early
youth for prudence and profound intelligence, liberality and
nobility of soul.<a id='r265' href='#f265' class='c016'><sup>[265]</sup></a> He was charged by the Caliph Al-Mahdi with
the education of his son Harun, hence the latter was accustomed
to call him father; and, until the assassination of the fantastic
tyrant Al-Hádi, who proposed to make his own child Caliph, he
had no little difficulty in preserving the youth from death in
prison. The Orthodox, once seated firmly on the throne, appointed
Yahya his Grand Wazir. This great administrator had four sons,
Al-Fazl, Ja’afar, Mohammed, and Musa,<a id='r266' href='#f266' class='c016'><sup>[266]</sup></a> in whose time the house
of Bermek rose to that height from which decline and fall are, in
the East, well nigh certain and immediate. Al-Fazl was a foster-brother
of Harun, an exchange of suckling infants having taken
place between the two mothers for the usual object, a tightening
of the ties of intimacy: he was a man of exceptional mind, but
he lacked the charm of temper and manner which characterised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Ja’afar. The poets and rhetoricians have been profuse in their
praises of the cadet who appears in The Nights as an adviser of
calm sound sense, an intercessor and a peace-maker, and even
more remarkable than the rest of his family for an almost
incredible magnanimity and generosity—<span lang="fr">une générosité effrayante</span>.
Mohammed was famed for exalted views and nobility of sentiment
and Musa for bravery and energy: of both it was justly said,
“They did good and harmed not.”<a id='r267' href='#f267' class='c016'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For ten years (not including an interval of seven) from the time
of Al-Rashid’s accession (A.D. 786) to the date of their fall,
(A.D. 803), Yahya and his sons, Al-Fazl and Ja’afar, were
virtually rulers of the great heterogeneous empire, which extended
from Mauritania to Tartary, and they did notable service in
arresting its disruption. Their downfall came sudden and terrible
like “a thunderbolt from the blue.” As the Caliph and Ja’afar
were halting in Al-’Umr (the convent) near Anbár-town on the
Euphrates, after a convivial evening spent in different pavilions,
Harun during the dead of the night called up his page Yásir
al-Rikhlah<a id='r268' href='#f268' class='c016'><sup>[268]</sup></a> and bade him bring Ja’afar’s head. The messenger
found Ja’afar still carousing with the blind poet Abú Zakkár
and the Christian physician Gabriel ibn Bakhtiashú, and was
persuaded to return to the Caliph and report his death; the
Wazir adding, “An he express regret I shall owe thee my life;
and, if not, whatso Allah will be done.” Ja’afar followed
to listen and heard only the Caliph exclaim, “O sucker
of thy mother’s clitoris, if thou answer me another word,
I will send thee before him!” whereupon he at once bandaged
his own eyes and received the fatal blow. Al-Asma’í, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>was summoned to the presence shortly after, recounts that
when the head was brought to Harun he gazed at it, and
summoning two witnesses commanded them to decapitate Yasir,
crying, “I cannot bear to look upon the slayer of Ja’afar!” His
vengeance did not cease with the death: he ordered the head to
be gibbetted at one end and the trunk at the other abutment of
the Tigris bridge where the corpses of the vilest malefactors used
to be exposed; and, some months afterwards, he insulted the
remains by having them burned—the last and worst indignity
which can be offered to a Moslem. There are indeed pity and
terror in the difference between two such items in the Treasury-accounts
as these: “Four hundred thousand dinars (£200,000) to a
robe of honour for the Wazir Ja’afar bin Yahya;” and, “Ten
kírát, (5 shill.) to naphtha and reeds for burning the body of Ja’afar
the Barmecide.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Yahya and Al-Fazl, seized by the Caliph Harun’s
command at Baghdad, were significantly cast into the prison
“Habs al-Zanádikah”—of the Guebres—and their immense
wealth which, some opine, hastened their downfall, was confiscated.
According to the historian, Al-Tabari, who, however,
is not supported by all the annalists, the whole Barmecide family,
men, women, and children, numbering over a thousand, were
slaughtered with only three exceptions; Yahya, his brother
Mohammed, and his son Al-Fazl. The Caliph’s foster-father, who
lived to the age of seventy-four, was allowed to die in jail
(A.H. 805) after two years’ imprisonment at Rukkah. Al-Fazl,
after having been tortured with two hundred blows in order to
make him produce concealed property, survived his father three
years and died in Nov. A.H. 808, some four months before his
terrible foster-brother. A pathetic tale is told of the son warming
water for the old man’s use by pressing the copper ewer to his
stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motives of this terrible massacre are variously recounted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>but no sufficient explanation has yet been, or possibly ever will
be, given. The popular idea is embodied in The Nights.<a id='r269' href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Harun,
wishing Ja’afar to be his companion even in the Harem, had
wedded him, <span lang="la">pro formâ</span>, to his eldest sister Abbásah, “the loveliest
woman of her day,” and brilliant in mind as in body; but he had
expressly said, “I will marry thee to her, that it may be lawful for
thee to look upon her but thou shalt not touch her.” Ja’afar
bound himself by a solemn oath; but his mother Attábah was
mad enough to deceive him in his cups and the result was a boy
(Ibn Khallikan) or, according to others, twins. The issue was
sent under the charge of a confidential eunuch and a slave-girl
to Meccah for concealment; but the secret was divulged to
Zubaydah who had her own reasons for hating husband and
wife and cherished an especial grievance against Yahya.<a id='r270' href='#f270' class='c016'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Thence
it soon found its way to head-quarters. Harun’s treatment of
Abbásah supports the general conviction: according to the most
credible accounts she and her child were buried alive in a pit
under the floor of her apartment.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, possibly, Ja’afar’s perjury was only “the last straw.”
Already Al-Fazl bin Rabí’a, the deadliest enemy of the Barmecides,
had been entrusted (A.D. 786) with the Wazirate which
he kept seven years. Ja’afar had also acted generously but
imprudently in abetting the escape of Yahya bin Abdillah, Sayyid
and Alide, for whom the Caliph had commanded confinement in a
close dark dungeon: when charged with disobedience the Wazir
had made full confession and Harun had (they say) exclaimed,
“Thou hast done well!” but was heard to mutter, “Allah slay
me an I slay thee not.”<a id='r271' href='#f271' class='c016'><sup>[271]</sup></a> The great house seems at times to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>abused its powers by being too peremptory with Harun and
Zubaydah, especially in money matters;<a id='r272' href='#f272' class='c016'><sup>[272]</sup></a> and its very greatness
would have created for it many and powerful enemies and
detractors who plied the Caliph with anonymous verse and prose.
Nor was it forgotten that, before the spread of Al-Islam, they had
presided over the Naubehár or Pyræthrum of Balkh; and Harun
is said to have remarked anent Yahya, “The zeal for magianism,
rooted in his heart, induces him to save all the monuments
connected with his faith.”<a id='r273' href='#f273' class='c016'><sup>[273]</sup></a> Hence the charge that they were
“Zanádakah,” a term properly applied to those who study the
Zend scripture, but popularly meaning Mundanists, Positivists,
Reprobates, Atheists; and it may be noted that, immediately
after Al-Rashid’s death, violent religious troubles broke out in
Baghdad. Ibn Khallikan<a id='r274' href='#f274' class='c016'><sup>[274]</sup></a> quotes Sa’íd ibn Sálim, a well-known
grammarian and traditionist who philosophically remarked, “Of a
truth the Barmecides did nothing to deserve Al-Rashid’s severity,
but the day (of their power and prosperity) had been long and
whatso endureth long waxeth longsome.” Fakhr al-Din says
(p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>), “<span lang="fr">On attribue encore leur ruine aux manières fières et
orgueilleuses de Djafar (Ja’afar) et de Fadhl (Al-Fazl), manières
que les rois ne sauroient supporter</span>.” According to Ibn
Badrún, the poet, when the Caliph’s sister ’Olayyah<a id='r275' href='#f275' class='c016'><sup>[275]</sup></a> asked him,
“O my lord, I have not seen thee enjoy one happy day since
putting Ja’afar to death: wherefore didst thou slay him?” he
answered, “My dear life, an I thought that my shirt knew the
reason I would rend it in pieces!” I therefore hold with
Al-Mas’udi, “As regards the intimate cause (of the catastrophe)
it is unknown and Allah is Omniscient.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Aaron the Orthodox appears sincerely to have repented his
enormous crime. From that date he never enjoyed refreshing
sleep: he would have given his whole realm to recall Ja’afar to
life; and, if any spoke slightingly of the Barmecides in his
presence, he would exclaim, “God damn your fathers! Cease
to blame them or fill the void they have left.” And he had
ample reason to mourn the loss. After the extermination of the
wise and enlightened family, the affairs of the Caliphate never
prospered: Fazl bin Rabí’a, though a man of intelligence
and devoted to letters, proved a poor substitute for Yahya
and Ja’afar; and the Caliph is reported to have applied to him
the couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No sire to your sire,<a id='r276' href='#f276' class='c016'><sup>[276]</sup></a> I bid you spare ✿ Your calumnies or their place replace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His unwise elevation of his two rival sons filled him with fear
of poison, and, lastly, the violence and recklessness of the popular
mourning for the Barmecides,<a id='r277' href='#f277' class='c016'><sup>[277]</sup></a> whose echo has not yet died away,
must have added poignancy to his tardy penitence. The crime
still “sticks fiery off” from the rest of Harun’s career: it stands
out in ghastly prominence as one of the most terrible tragedies
recorded by history, and its horrible details make men write
passionately on the subject to this our day.<a id='r278' href='#f278' class='c016'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As of Harun so of Zubaydah it may be said that she was far
superior in most things to contemporary royalties, and she was
not worse at her worst than the normal despot-queen of the
Morning-land. We must not take seriously the tales of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>jealousy in The Nights, which mostly end in her selling off or
burying alive her rivals; but, even were all true, she acted after
the recognised fashion of her exalted sisterhood. The secret
history of Cairo, during the last generation, tells of many a
viceregal dame who committed all the crimes, without any of
the virtues which characterised Harun’s cousin-spouse. And
the difference between the manners of the Caliphate and the
“respectability” of the nineteenth century may be measured by
the Tale called, “Al-Maamun and Zubaydah.”<a id='r279' href='#f279' class='c016'><sup>[279]</sup></a> The lady, having
won a game of forfeits from her husband, and being vexed with
him for imposing unseemly conditions when he had been the
winner, condemned him to lie with the foulest and filthiest
kitchen-wench in the palace; and thus was begotten the Caliph
who succeeded and destroyed her son.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zubaydah was the grand-daughter of the second Abbaside
Al-Mansur, by his son Ja’afar whom The Nights persistently
term Al-Kasim: her name was Amat al-Azíz or Handmaid of
the Almighty; her cognomen was Umm Ja’afar as her husband’s
was Abú Ja’afar; and her popular name “Creamkin” derives
from Zubdah,<a id='r280' href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a> cream or fresh butter, on account of her plumpness
and freshness. She was as majestic and munificent as her
husband; and the hum of prayer was never hushed in her
palace. Al-Mas’udi<a id='r281' href='#f281' class='c016'><sup>[281]</sup></a> makes a historian say to the dangerous
Caliph Al-Káhir, “The nobleness and generosity of this Princess, in
serious matters as in her diversions, place her in the highest rank”;
and he proceeds to give ample proof. Al-Siyuti relates how she
once filled a poet’s mouth with jewels which he sold for twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>thousand dinars. Ibn Khallikan (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_523">523</a>) affirms of her, “Her
charity was ample, her conduct virtuous, and the history of her
pilgrimage to Meccah and of what she undertook to execute on
the way is so well-known that it were useless to repeat it.” I
have noted (Pilgrimage iii. 2) how the Darb al-Sharki or Eastern
road from Meccah to Al-Medinah was due to the piety of
Zubaydah who dug wells from Baghdad to the Prophet’s burial
place and built not only cisterns and caravanserais, but even a
wall to direct pilgrims over the shifting sands. She also supplied
Meccah, which suffered severely from want of water, with the
chief requisite for public hygiene by connecting it, through levelled
hills and hewn rocks, with the Ayn al-Mushásh in the Arafat
subrange; and the fine aqueduct, some ten miles long, was
erected at a cost of 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 of gold pieces.<a id='r282' href='#f282' class='c016'><sup>[282]</sup></a> We
cannot wonder that her name is still famous among the Badawin
and the “Sons of the Holy Cities.” She died at Baghdad, after
a protracted widowhood, in A.H. 216 and her tomb, which still
exists, was long visited by the friends and dependents who
mourned the loss of a devout and most liberal woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will bear with me while I run through the tales and
add a few remarks to the notices given in the notes: the glance
must necessarily be brief, however extensive be the theme. The
admirable introduction follows, in all the texts and MSS. known
to me, the same main lines but differs greatly in minor details as
will be seen by comparing Mr. Payne’s translation with Lane’s
and mine. In the Tale of the Sage Dúbán appears the speaking
head which is found in the Kámil, in Mirkhond and in the
Kitáb al-Uyún: M. C. Barbier de Meynard (v. 503) traces it
back to an abbreviated text of Al-Mas’udi. I would especially
recommend to students The Porter and the Three Ladies of
Baghdad (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_82">82</a>), whose mighty orgie ends so innocently in general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>marriage. Lane (iii. 746) blames it “because it represents Arab
<em>ladies</em> as acting like Arab <em>courtesans</em>”; but he must have known
that during his day the indecent frolic was quite possible in some
of the highest circles of his beloved Cairo. To judge by the
style and changes of person, some of the most “archaic” expressions
suggest the hand of the Ráwi or professional tale-teller;
yet as they are in all the texts they cannot be omitted in a loyal
translation. The following story of The Three Apples perfectly
justifies my notes concerning which certain carpers complain.
What Englishman would be jealous enough to kill his cousin-wife
because a blackamoor in the streets boasted of her favours?
But after reading what is annotated in vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_6">6</a>, and purposely
placed there to give the key-note of the book, he will understand
the reasonable nature of the suspicion; and I may add that the
same cause has commended these “skunks of the human race”
to debauched women in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next tale, sometimes called “The Two Wazírs” is notable
for its regular and genuine drama-intrigue which, however, appears
still more elaborate and perfected in other pieces. The richness of
this Oriental plot-invention contrasts strongly with all European
literatures except the Spaniard’s, whose taste for the theatre
determined his direction, and the Italian, which in Boccaccio’s
day had borrowed freely through Sicily from the East. And the
remarkable deficiency lasted till the romantic movement dawned
in France, when Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas showed their
marvellous powers of faultless fancy, boundless imagination and
scenic luxuriance, “raising French Poetry from the dead and <em>not</em>
mortally wounding French prose.”<a id='r283' href='#f283' class='c016'><sup>[283]</sup></a> The Two Wazirs is followed
by the gem of the volume, The Adventure of the Hunchback-jester
(i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_225">225</a>), also containing an admirable surprise and a fine development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of character, while its “wild but natural simplicity” and its
humour are so abounding that it has echoed through the world
to the farthest West. It gave to Addison the Story of Alnaschar<a id='r284' href='#f284' class='c016'><sup>[284]</sup></a>
and to Europe the term “Barmecide Feast,” from the “Tale of
Shacabac” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_343">343</a>). The adventures of the corpse were
known in Europe long before Galland, as shown by three fabliaux
in Barbazan. I have noticed that the Barber’s Tale of himself
(i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_317">317</a>) is historical and I may add that it is told in detail by
Al-Mas’udi (chapt. cxiv).</p>

<p class='c000'>Follows the tale of Núr al-Dín Alí, and what Galland miscalls
“The Fair Persian,” a brightly written historiette with not a few
touches of true humour. Noteworthy are the Slaver’s address
(vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_15">15</a>), the fine description of the Baghdad garden (vol. ii.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_21">21</a>–24), the drinking-party (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_25">25</a>), the Caliph’s frolic (vol. ii.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_31">31</a>–37) and the happy end of the hero’s misfortunes (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_44">44</a>).
Its brightness is tempered by the gloomy tone of the tale which
succeeds, and which has variants in the Bágh o Bahár, a
Hindustani version of the Persian “Tale of the Four Darwayshes;”
and in the Turkish Kirk Vezir or “Book of the Forty Vezirs.”
Its dismal <span lang="fr">péripéties</span> are relieved only by the witty indecency of
Eunuch Bukhayt and the admirable humour of Eunuch Káfur,
whose “half-lie” is known throughout the East. Here also the
lover’s agonies are piled upon him for the purpose of unpiling at
last: the Oriental tale-teller knows by experience that, as a rule,
doleful endings “don’t pay.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>The next is the long romance of chivalry, “King Omar bin al-Nu’man”
etc., which occupies an eighth of the whole repertory
and the best part of two volumes. Mr. Lane omits it because
“obscene and tedious,” showing the license with which he translated;
and he was set right by a learned reviewer,<a id='r285' href='#f285' class='c016'><sup>[285]</sup></a> who truly
declared that “the omission of half-a-dozen passages out of
four hundred pages would fit it for printing in any language<a id='r286' href='#f286' class='c016'><sup>[286]</sup></a> and
the charge of tediousness could hardly have been applied more
unhappily.” The tale is interesting as a picture of mediæval Arab
chivalry and has many other notable points; for instance, the lines
(iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_86">86</a>) beginning “Allah holds the kingship!” are a lesson to the
manichæanism of Christian Europe. It relates the doings of three
royal generations and has all the characteristics of Eastern art: it
is a phantasmagoria of Holy Places, palaces and Harems; convents,
castles and caverns, here restful with gentle landscapes (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_240">240</a>)
and there bristling with furious battle-pictures (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_117">117</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_221">221</a>–8,
249) and tales of princely prowess and knightly derring-do. The
characters stand out well. King Nu’man is an old lecher who
deserves his death; the ancient Dame Zát al-Dawáhí merits her
title Lady of Calamities (to her foes); Princess Abrízah appears
as a charming Amazon, doomed to a miserable and pathetic end;
Zau al-Makán is a wise and pious royalty; Nuzhat al-Zamán,
though a longsome talker, is a model sister; the Wazir Dandán,
a sage and sagacious counsellor, contrasts with the Chamberlain,
an ambitious miscreant; Kánmakán is the typical Arab knight,
gentle and brave:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>And the kind-hearted, simple-minded Stoker serves as a foil to
the villains, the kidnapping Badawi and Ghazbán the detestable
negro. The fortunes of the family are interrupted by two episodes,
both equally remarkable. Taj al-Mulúk<a id='r287' href='#f287' class='c016'><sup>[287]</sup></a> is the model
lover whom no difficulties or dangers can daunt. In Azíz
and Azízah (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_291">291</a>) we have the beau idéal of a loving woman:
the writer’s object was to represent a “softy” who had the luck
to win the love of a beautiful and clever cousin and the mad folly
to break her heart. The poetical justice which he receives at
the hands of women of quite another stamp leaves nothing to be
desired. Finally the plot of “King Omar” is well worked out;
and the gathering of all the actors upon the stage before the
curtain drops may be improbable but it is highly artistic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long Crusading Romance is relieved by a sequence of
sixteen fabliaux, partly historiettes of men and beasts and
partly apologues proper—a subject already noticed. We have
then (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_162">162</a>) the saddening and dreary love-tale of Ali bin
Bakkár, a Persian youth and the Caliph’s concubine Shams al-Nahár.
Here the end is made doleful enough by the deaths of
the “two martyrs,” who are killed off, like Romeo and Juliet,<a id='r288' href='#f288' class='c016'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
a lesson that the course of true Love is sometimes troubled and
that men as well as women <em>can</em> die of the so-called “tender
passion.” It is followed (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_212">212</a>) by the long tale of Kamar al-Zamán,
or Moon of the Age, the first of that name, the “Camaralzaman”
whom Galland introduced into the best European
society. Like “The Ebony Horse” it seems to have been
derived from a common source with “Peter of Provence” and
“Cleomades and Claremond”; and we can hardly wonder at its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>wide diffusion: the tale is brimful of life, change, movement,
containing as much character and incident as would fill a modern
three-volumer and the Supernatural pleasantly jostles the Natural;
Dahnash the Jinn and Maymúnah daughter of Al-Dimiryát,<a id='r289' href='#f289' class='c016'><sup>[289]</sup></a> a
renowned King of the Jann, being as human in their jealousy
about the virtue of their lovers as any children of Adam, and
so their metamorphosis to fleas has all the effect of a surprise.
The <i><span lang="fr">troupe</span></i> is again drawn with a broad firm touch. Prince
Charming, the hero, is weak and wilful, shifty and immoral, hasty
and violent: his two spouses are rivals in abominations as his
sons, Amjad and As’ad, are examples of a fraternal affection
rarely found in half-brothers by sister-wives. There is at least
one fine melodramatic situation (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_228">228</a>); and marvellous feats of
indecency, a practical joke which would occur only to the canopic
mind (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_300">300</a>–305), emphasise the recovery of her husband by that
remarkable “blackguard,” the Lady Budúr. The interpolated tale
of Ni’amah and Naomi (iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>), a simple and pleasing narrative of
youthful amours, contrasts well with the boiling passions of the
incestuous and murderous Queens and serves as a pause before
the grand <i><span lang="fr">dénoûement</span></i> when the parted meet, the lost are found,
the unwedded are wedded and all ends merrily as a xixth century
novel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long tale of Alá al-Din, our old friend “Aladdin,” is wholly
out of place in its present position (iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_29">29</a>): it is a counterpart of
Ali Núr al-Dín and Miriam the Girdle-girl (vol. ix. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55587/55587-h/55587-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>); and
the mention of the Shahbandar or Harbour-master (iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_29">29</a>), the
Kunsúl or Consul (p. <a href='#Page_84'>84</a>), the Kaptán (Capitano), the use of
cannon at sea and the choice of Genoa-city (p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>) prove that it belongs
to the xvth or xvith century and should accompany Kamar
al-Zamán II. and Ma’aruf at the end of The Nights. Despite the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>lutist Zubaydah being carried off by the Jinn, the Magic Couch,
a modification of Solomon’s carpet, and the murder of the King
who refused to islamize, it is evidently a European tale and I
believe with Dr. Bacher that it is founded upon the legend of
“Charlemagne’s” daughter Emma and his secretary Eginhardt,
as has been noted in the counterpart (vol. ix. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55587/55587-h/55587-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>This quasi-historical fiction is followed by a succession of
fabliaux, novelle and historiettes which fill the rest of vol. iv.
and the whole of vol. v. till we reach the terminal story, The
Queen of the Serpents (vol. v. pp. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_304">304</a>–329). It appears to me
that most of them are historical and could easily be traced. Not
a few are in Al-Mas’udi; for instance the grim Tale of Hatim
of Tayy (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_94">94</a>) is given bodily in “Meads of Gold” (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_327">327</a>);
and the two adventures of Ibrahim al-Mahdi with the barber-surgeon

The City of Lubtayt (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_99">99</a>)
embodies the legend of Don Rodrigo, last of the Goths, and may

the Tale of Tawaddud (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_139">139</a>) we have the fullest development
of the disputations and displays of learning then so common
in Europe, teste the “Admirable Crichton”; and these were affected
not only by Eastern tale-tellers but even by sober historians. To
us it is much like “padding” when Nuzhat al-Zamán (vol. ii.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_156">156</a> etc.) fags her hapless hearers with a discourse covering sixteen
mortal pages; when the Wazir Dandan (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_195">195</a> etc.) reports
at length the cold speeches of the five high-bosomed maids and
the Lady of Calamities and when Wird Khan, in presence of his
papa (Nights cmxiv-xvi.) discharges his patristic exercitations and
heterogeneous knowledge. Yet Al-Mas’udi also relates, at dreary
extension (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_369">369</a>) the disputation of the twelve sages in

(vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_181">181</a>) shows Honayn, author of the Book of Natural Questions,
undergoing a long examination before the Caliph Al-Wásik
(Vathek) and describing, amongst other things, the human teeth.

<p class='c000'>These disjecta membra of tales and annals are pleasantly
relieved by the seven voyages of Sindbad the Seaman (vol. vi.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>–83). The “Arabian Odyssey” may, like its Greek brother,
descend from a noble family, the “Shipwrecked Mariner,” a Coptic
travel-tale of the twelfth dynasty (B.C. 3500) preserved on a papyrus
at St. Petersburg. In its actual condition “Sindbad” is a fanciful
compilation, like De Foe’s “Captain Singleton,” borrowed from
travellers’ tales of an immense variety and extracts from Al-Idrísi,
Al-Kazwíni and Ibn al-Wardi. Here we find the Polyphemus, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Pygmies and the cranes of Homer and Herodotus; the escape of
Aristomenes; the Plinian monsters well known in Persia; the
magnetic mountain of Saint Brennan (Brandanus); the aeronautics
of “Duke Ernest of Bavaria”<a id='r291' href='#f291' class='c016'><sup>[291]</sup></a> and sundry cuttings from Moslem
writers dating between our ninth and fourteenth centuries.<a id='r292' href='#f292' class='c016'><sup>[292]</sup></a> The
“Shaykh of the Seaboard” appears in the Persian romance of
Kámarupa translated by Francklin, all the particulars absolutely
corresponding. The “Odyssey” is valuable because it shows how
far Eastward the mediæval Arab had extended: already in The
Ignorance he had reached China and had formed a centre of trade
at Canton. But the higher merit of the cento is to produce one of
the most charming books of travel ever written, like Robinson
Crusoe the delight of children and the admiration of all ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hearty life and realism of Sindbad are made to stand out in
strong relief by the deep melancholy which pervades “The City of
Brass” (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_83">83</a>), a dreadful book for a dreary day. It is curious
to compare the doleful verses (pp. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>, <a href='#Page_105'>105</a>) with those spoken to
Caliph Al-Mutawakkil by Abu al-Hasan Ali (Al-Mas’udi, vii. 246).
We then enter upon the venerable Sindibad-nameh, the Malice of
Women (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_122">122</a>), of which, according to the Kitab al-Fihrist,
(vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_305">305</a>) there were two editions,  a Sinzibád al-Kabír and a
Sinzibád al-Saghír, the latter being probably an epitome of the
former. This bundle of legends, I have shown, was incorporated
with The Nights as an editor’s addition; and as an independent
work it has made the round of the world. Space forbids any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>detailed notice of this choice collection of anecdotes for which a
volume would be required. I may, however, note that the “Wife’s
device” (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_152">152</a>) has its analogues in the Kathá (chapt. xiii.)
in the Gesta Romanorum (No. xxviii.) and in Boccaccio (Day iii. 6
and Day vi. 8), modified by La Fontaine to Richard Minutolo
(Contes lib. i. tale 2): it is quoted almost in the words of The
Nights by the Shaykh al-Nafzáwi (p. <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>). That most witty and
indecent tale The Three Wishes (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_180">180</a>) has forced its way
disguised as a babe into our nurseries. Another form of it is
found in the Arab proverb “More luckless than Basús” (Kamus),
a fair Israelite who persuaded her husband, also a Jew, to wish
that she might become the loveliest of women. Jehovah granted
it, spitefully as Jupiter; the consequence was that her contumacious
treatment of her mate made him pray that the beauty
might be turned into a bitch; and the third wish restored her to
her original state.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Story of Júdar (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_207">207</a>) is Egyptian, to judge from its
local knowledge (pp. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a> and <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>) together with its ignorance of
Marocco (p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>). It shows a contrast, in which Arabs delight, of
an almost angelical goodness and forgiveness with a well-nigh
diabolical malignity, and we find the same extremes in Abú Sír
the noble-minded Barber and the hideously inhuman Abú Kír.
The excursion to Mauritania is artfully managed and gives a
novelty to the <i><span lang="fr">mise-en-scène</span></i>. Gharíb and Ajíb (vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_207">207</a>, vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_91">91</a>)
belongs to the cycle of Antar and King Omar bin Nu’man: its
exaggerations make it a fine type of Oriental Chauvinism, pitting
the superhuman virtues, valour, nobility and success of all that is
Moslem, against the scum of the earth which is non-Moslem.
Like the exploits of Friar John of the Chopping-knives (Rabelais i.
c. 27) it suggests ridicule cast on impossible battles and tales of
giants, paynims and paladins. The long romance is followed by
thirteen historiettes all apparently historical: compare “Hind,
daughter of Al-Nu’man” (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_7">7</a>–145) and “Isaac of Mosul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and the Devil” (vol. vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_136">136</a>–139) with Al-Mas’udi v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_365">365</a> and
vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_340">340</a>. They end in two long detective-tales like those which
M. Gaboriau has popularised, the Rogueries of Dalilah and the
Adventures of Mercury Ali, based upon the principle, “One thief
wots another.” The former, who has appeared before (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_329">329</a>),
seems to have been a noted character: Al-Mas’udi says (viii. 175)
“in a word this Shaykh (Al-’Ukáb) outrivalled in his rogueries
and the ingenuities of his wiles <em>Dállah</em> (Dalilah?) the <em>Crafty</em> and
other tricksters and coney-catchers, ancient and modern.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tale of Ardashir (vol. vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_209">209</a>–264) lacks originality: we
are now entering upon a series of pictures which are replicas of
those preceding. This is not the case with that charming Undine,
Julnár the Sea-born (vol. vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_264">264</a>–308) which, like Abdullah of
the Land and Abdullah of the Sea (vol. ix. Night cmxl.), describes
the vie intime of mermen and merwomen. Somewhat resembling
Swift’s inimitable creations, the Houyhnhnms for instance, they
prove, amongst other things, that those who dwell in a denser
element can justly blame and severely criticise the contradictory
and unreasonable prejudices and predilections of mankind. Sayf
al-Mulúk (vol. viii. Night dcclviii.), the romantic tale of two lovers,
shows by its introduction that it was originally an independent
work and it is known to have existed in Persia during the eleventh
century: this novella has found its way into every Moslem
language of the East even into Sindi, which calls the hero “Sayfal.”
Here we again meet the Old Man of the Sea or rather the
Shaykh of the Seaboard and make acquaintance with a Jinn
whose soul is outside his body: thus he resembles Hermotimos
of Klazamunæ in Apollonius, whose spirit left his mortal frame à
discretion. The author, philanthropically remarking (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_4">4</a>)
“Knowest thou not that a single mortal is better, in Allah’s sight,
than a thousand Jinn?” brings the wooing to a happy end which
leaves a pleasant savour upon the mental palate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hasan of Bassorah (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_7">7</a>–145) is a Master Shoetie on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>large scale like Sindbad, but his voyages and travels extend into
the supernatural and fantastic rather than the natural world.
Though long the tale is by no means wearisome and the characters
are drawn with a fine firm hand. The hero with his hen-like
persistency of purpose, his weeping, fainting and versifying is
interesting enough and proves that “Love can find out the
way.” The charming adopted sister, the model of what the
feminine friend should be; the silly little wife who never knows
that she is happy till she loses happiness; the violent and hardhearted
queen with all the cruelty of a good woman, and the
manners and customs of Amazon-land are outlined with a life-like
vivacity. Khalífah the next tale (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_145">145</a>–184) is valuable as
a study of Eastern life, showing how the fisherman emerges from
the squalor of his surroundings and becomes one of the Caliph’s
favourite cup-companions. Ali Nur al-Din (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_264">264</a>) and King
Jali’ad (vol. ix., Night dcccxciv.) have been noticed elsewhere and
there is little to say of the concluding stories which bear the
evident impress of a more modern date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Johnson thus sums up his notice of The Tempest. “Whatever
might have been the intention of their author, these tales
are made instrumental to the production of many characters,
diversified with boundless invention, and preserved with profound
skill in nature, extensive knowledge of opinions, and accurate
observation of life. Here are exhibited princes, courtiers and
sailors, all speaking in their real characters. There is the agency
of airy spirits and of earthy goblin, the operations of magic, the
tumults of a storm, the adventures of a desert island, the native
effusion of untaught affection, the punishment of guilt, and the
final happiness of those for whom our passions and reason are
equally interested.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We can fairly say this much and far more for our Tales.
Viewed as a tout ensemble in full and complete form, they are
a drama of Eastern life, and a Dance of Death made sublime by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>faith and the highest emotions, by the certainty of expiation and
the fulness of atoning equity, where virtue is victorious, vice is
vanquished and the ways of Allah are justified to man. They are
a panorama which remains ken-speckle upon the mental retina.
They form a phantasmagoria in which archangels and angels,
devils and goblins, men of air, of fire, of water, naturally mingle
with men of earth; where flying horses and talking fishes are
utterly realistic: where King and Prince meet fisherman and
pauper, lamia and cannibal; where citizen jostles Badawi,
eunuch meets knight; the Kazi hob-nobs with the thief; the
pure and pious sit down to the same tray with the bawd and the
pimp; where the professional religionist, the learned Koranist and
the strictest moralist consort with the wicked magician, the scoffer
and the debauchee-poet like Abu Nowas; where the courtier
jests with the boor and where the sweep is bedded with the noble
lady. And the characters are “finished and quickened by a few
touches swift and sure as the glance of sunbeams.” The work is a
kaleidoscope where everything falls into picture; gorgeous palaces
and pavilions; grisly underground caves and deadly wolds; gardens
fairer than those of the Hesperid; seas dashing with clashing
billows upon enchanted mountains; valleys of the Shadow of
Death; air-voyages and promenades in the abysses of ocean; the
duello, the battle and the siege; the wooing of maidens and the
marriage-rite. All the splendour and squalor, the beauty and
baseness, the glamour and grotesqueness, the magic and the
mournfulness, the bravery and the baseness of Oriental life are
here: its pictures of the three great Arab passions, love, war and
fancy, entitle it to be called “Blood, Musk and Hashish.”<a id='r293' href='#f293' class='c016'><sup>[293]</sup></a> And
still more, the genius of the story-teller quickens the dry bones of
history, and by adding Fiction to Fact revives the dead past: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Caliphs and the Caliphate return to Baghdad and Cairo, whilst
Asmodeus kindly removes the terrace-roof of every tenement and
allows our curious glances to take in the whole interior. This is
perhaps the best proof of their power. Finally, the picture-gallery
opens with a series of weird and striking adventures and shows as
a tail-piece, an idyllic scene of love and wedlock in halls before
reeking with lust and blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have noticed in my Foreword that the two main characteristics
of The Nights are Pathos and Humour, alternating with highly
artistic contrast, and carefully calculated to provoke tears and
smiles in the coffee-house audience which paid for them. The
sentimental portion mostly breathes a tender passion and a simple
sadness: such are the Badawi’s dying farewell (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_75">75</a>); the
lady’s broken heart on account of her lover’s hand being cut off
(vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_277">277</a>); the Wazir’s death, the mourner’s song and the
“tongue of the case” (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_10">10</a>); the murder of Princess Abrízah
with the babe sucking its dead mother’s breast (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_128">128</a>); and,
generally, the last moments of good Moslems (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_167">167</a>),
which are described with inimitable terseness and naïveté. The
sad and the gay mingle in the character of the good Hammamstoker
who becomes Roi Crotte; and the melancholy deepens in
the Tale of the Mad Lover (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_138">138</a>); the Blacksmith who
could handle fire without hurt (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_271">271</a>); the Devotee Prince
(vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_111">111</a>) and the whole Tale of Azízah (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_298">298</a>), whose
angelic love is set off by the sensuality and selfishness of her more
fortunate rivals. A new note of absolutely tragic dignity seems
to be struck in the Sweep and the Noble Lady (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_125">125</a>),
showing the piquancy of sentiment which can be evolved from the
common and the unclean. The pretty conceit of the Lute (vol. v.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_244">244</a>) is afterwards carried out in the Song (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_281">281</a>), which is
a masterpiece of originality<a id='r294' href='#f294' class='c016'><sup>[294]</sup></a> and (in the Arabic) of exquisite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>tenderness and poetic melancholy, the wail over the past and the
vain longing for reunion. And the very depths of melancholy, of
majestic pathos and of true sublimity are reached in Many-columned
Iram (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_113">113</a>) and the City of Brass (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_83">83</a>):
the metrical part of the latter shows a luxury of woe; it is one long
wail of despair which echoes long and loud in the hearer’s heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>In my Foreword I have compared the humorous vein of the
comic tales with our northern “wut,” chiefly for the dryness and
slyness which pervade it. But it differs in degree as much as the
pathos varies. The staple article is Cairene “chaff,” a peculiar
banter possibly inherited from their pagan forefathers: instances
of this are found in the Cock and Dog (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_22">22</a>), the Eunuch’s
address to the Cook (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_244">244</a>), the Wazir’s exclamation, “Too
little pepper!” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_246">246</a>), the self-communing of Judar (vol.
vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_219">219</a>), the Hashish-eater in Ali Shár (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_213">213</a>), the scene
between the brother-Wazirs (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_197">197</a>), the treatment of the
Gobbo (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_221">221</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_228">228</a>), the Water of Zemzem (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_284">284</a>),
and the Eunuchs Bukhayt and Kafur<a id='r295' href='#f295' class='c016'><sup>[295]</sup></a> (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_49">49</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_51">51</a>). At
times it becomes a masterpiece of fun, of rollicking Rabelaisian
humour underlaid by the caustic mother-wit of Sancho Panza,
as in the orgie of the Ladies of Baghdad (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_92">92</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_93">93</a>); the
Holy Ointment applied to the beard of Luka the Knight—“<span lang="la">unxerunt
regem Salomonem</span>” (vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_222">222</a>); and Ja’afar and
the Old Badawi (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_98">98</a>), with its reminiscence of “chaffy”
King Amasis. This reaches its acme in the description of ugly
old age (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_3">3</a>); in The Three Wishes, the wickedest of satires on
the alter sexus (vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_180">180</a>); in Ali the Persian (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_139">139</a>); in the
Lady and her Five Suitors (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_172">172</a>), which corresponds and
contrasts with the dully told Story of Upakosa and her Four
Lovers of the Kathá (p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>); and in The Man of Al-Yaman (vol.
iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_245">245</a>) where we find the true Falstaffian touch. But there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>sterling wit, sweet and bright, expressed without any artifice of
words, in the immortal Barber’s tales of his brothers, especially the
second, the fifth and the sixth (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_324">324</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_325">325</a> and 343). Finally,
wherever the honest and independent old debauchee Abu Nowas
makes his appearance the fun becomes fescennine and milesian.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>B.—<span class='sc'>The Manner of The Nights.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>And now, after considering the matter, I will glance at the
language and style of The Nights. The first point to remark is
the peculiarly happy framework of the Recueil, which I cannot
but suspect set an example to the Decamerone and its host of
successors.<a id='r296' href='#f296' class='c016'><sup>[296]</sup></a> The admirable Introduction, a perfect <i><span lang="fr">mise-en-scène</span></i>,
gives the amplest raison d’être of the work, which thus has all the
unity required for a great romantic recueil. We perceive this
when reading the contemporary Hindu work the Kathá Sarit
Ságara,<a id='r297' href='#f297' class='c016'><sup>[297]</sup></a> which is at once so like and so unlike The Nights: here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the preamble is insufficient; the whole is clumsy for want of a
thread upon which the many independent tales and fables should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>be strung<a id='r298' href='#f298' class='c016'><sup>[298]</sup></a>; and the consequent disorder and confusion tell upon
the reader, who cannot remember the sequence without taking
notes.</p>

<p class='c000'>As was said in my Foreword “without the Nights no Arabian
Nights!” and now, so far from holding the pauses “an
intolerable interruption to the narrative,” I attach additional importance
to these pleasant and restful breaks introduced into
long and intricate stories. Indeed beginning again I should adopt
the plan of the Cal. Edit. opening and ending every division with
a dialogue between the sisters. Upon this point, however, opinions
will differ and the critic will remind me that the consensus of the
MSS. would be wanting: The Bresl. Edit. in many places merely
interjects the number of the night without interrupting the tale;
the MS. in the <span lang="fr">Bibliothèque Nationale</span> used by Galland contains
only cclxxxii and the Frenchman ceases to use the division after
the ccxxxvith Night and in some editions after the cxcviith.<a id='r299' href='#f299' class='c016'><sup>[299]</sup></a> A
fragmentary MS., according to Scott whose friend J. Anderson found
it in Bengal, breaks away after Night xxix; and in the Wortley
Montagu, the Sultan relents at an early opportunity, the stories, as
in Galland, continuing only as an amusement. I have been careful
to preserve the balanced sentences with which the tales open; the
tautology and the prose-rhyme serving to attract attention, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>,
“In days of yore and in times long gone before there was a
King,” etc.; in England where we strive not to waste words this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>becomes “Once upon a time.” The closings also are artfully
calculated, by striking a minor chord after the rush and hurry
of the incidents, to suggest repose: “And they led the most
pleasurable of lives and the most delectable, till there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies and
they became as though they had never been”. Place this by the
side of Boccaccio’s favourite formulæ:—<span lang="it">Egli conquistò poi la
Scozia, e funne re coronato (ii, 3); Et onorevolmente visse infino
àlla fine (ii, 4),; Molte volte goderono del loro amore: Iddio
faccia noi goder del nostro (iii, 6): E cosi nella sua grossezza si
rimase e ancor vi si sta (vi, 8).</span> We have further docked this
tail into: “And they lived happily ever after.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot take up the Nights, in their present condition, without
feeling that the work has been written down from the Ráwi or
Nakkál,<a id='r300' href='#f300' class='c016'><sup>[300]</sup></a> the conteur or professional story-teller, also called Kassás
and Maddáh, corresponding with the Hindu Bhat or Bard. To
these men my learned friend Baron A. von Kremer would attribute
the Mu’allakát vulgarly called the Suspended Poems, as being
“indited from the relation of the Ráwi.” Hence in our text the
frequent interruption of the formula Kál’ al-Ráwi = quotes the
reciter; <i><span lang="la">dice Turpino</span></i>. Moreover, The Nights read in many places
like a hand-book or guide for the professional, who would learn
them by heart; here and there introducing his “gag” and
“patter.” To this “business” possibly we may attribute much of
the ribaldry which starts up in unexpected places: it was meant
simply to provoke a laugh. How old the custom is and how unchangeable
is Eastern life is shown, a correspondent suggests, by
the Book of Esther which might form part of The Alf Laylah.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“On that night (we read in Chap. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>) could not the King
sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the
chronicles; and they were read before the King.” The Ráwi
would declaim the recitative somewhat in conversational style;
he would intone the Saj’a or prose-rhyme and he would chant to
the twanging of the Rabáb, a one-stringed viol, the poetical
parts. Dr. Scott<a id='r301' href='#f301' class='c016'><sup>[301]</sup></a> borrows from the historian of Aleppo a life-like
picture of the Story-teller. “He recites walking to and fro in the
middle of the coffee-room, stopping only now and then, when the
expression requires some emphatical attitude. He is commonly
heard with great attention; and not unfrequently in the midst of
some interesting adventure, when the expectation of his audience
is raised to the highest pitch, he breaks off abruptly and
makes his escape, leaving both his hero or heroine and his
audience in the utmost embarrassment. Those who happen to
be near the door endeavour to detain him, insisting upon the
story being finished before he departs; but he always makes his
retreat good<a id='r302' href='#f302' class='c016'><sup>[302]</sup></a>; and the auditors suspending their curiosity are
induced to return at the same time next day to hear the sequel.
He has no sooner made his exit than the company in separate
parties fall to disputing about the characters of the drama or
the event of an unfinished adventure. The controversy by degrees
becomes serious and opposite opinions are maintained with no
less warmth than if the fall of the city depended upon the
decision.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At Tangier, where a murder in a “coffee-house” had closed
these hovels, pending a sufficient payment to the Pasha; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>where, during the hard winter of 1885–86, the poorer classes were
compelled to puff their Kayf (Bhang, <em>cannabis indica</em>) and sip
their black coffee in the muddy streets under a rainy sky, I found
the Ráwi active on Sundays and Thursdays, the market-days.
The favourite place was the “Soko de barra,” or large bazar, outside
the town whose condition is that of Suez and Bayrut half a
century ago. It is a foul slope; now slippery with viscous mud,
then powdery with fetid dust, dotted with graves and decaying
tombs, unclean booths, gargottes and tattered tents, and frequented
by women, mere bundles of unclean rags, and by men wearing the
haik or burnús, a Franciscan frock, tending their squatting camels and
chaffering over cattle for Gibraltar beef-eaters. Here the market-people
form ring about the reciter, a stalwart man affecting little raiment
besides a broad waist-belt into which his lower chiffons are
tucked, and noticeable only for his shock hair, wild eyes, broad grin
and generally disreputable aspect. He usually handles a short
stick; and, when drummer and piper are absent, he carries a tiny
tom-tom shaped like an hour-glass, upon which he taps the periods.
This Scealuidhe, as the Irish call him, opens the drama with
extempore prayer, proving that he and the audience are good
Moslems: he speaks slowly and with emphasis, varying the diction
with breaks of animation, abundant action and the most comical
grimace: he advances, retires and wheels about, illustrating every
point with pantomime; and his features, voice and gestures are
so expressive that even Europeans who cannot understand a word
of Arabic divine the meaning of his tale. The audience stands
breathless and motionless surprising strangers<a id='r303' href='#f303' class='c016'><sup>[303]</sup></a> by the ingenuousness
and freshness of feeling hidden under their hard and savage
exterior. The performance usually ends with the embryo actor
going round for alms and flourishing in air every silver bit, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>usual honorarium being a few “f’lús,” that marvellous money of
Barbary, big coppers worth one-twelfth of a penny. All the tales
I heard were purely local, but Fakhri Bey, a young Osmanli
domiciled for some time in Fez and Mequinez, assured me that
The Nights are still recited there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many travellers, including Dr. Russell, have complained that
they failed to find a complete MS. copy of The Nights. Evidently
they never heard of the popular superstition which declares that
no one can read through them without dying—it is only fair that
my patrons should know this. Yacoub Artín Pasha declares that
the superstition dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
and he explains it in two ways. Firstly, it is a facetious exaggeration,
meaning that no one has leisure or patience to wade through
the long repertory. Secondly, the work is condemned as futile.
When Egypt produced savants and legists like Ibn al-Hajar, Al-’Ayni,
and Al-Kastalláni, to mention no others, the taste of the
country inclined to dry factual studies and positive science; nor,
indeed, has this taste wholly died out: there are not a few who,
like Khayri Pasha, contend that the mathematic is more useful
even for legal studies than history and geography, and at Cairo
the chief of the Educational Department has always been an
engineer, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, a mathematician. The Olema declared war against
all “futilities,” in which they included not only stories but also what
is politely entitled Authentic History. From this to the fatal
effect of such lecture is only a step. Society, however, cannot rest
without light literature; so the novel-reading class was thrown back
upon writings which had all the indelicacy and few of the merits
of The Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turkey is the only Moslem country which has dared to produce
a regular drama<a id='r304' href='#f304' class='c016'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and to arouse the energies of such brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>writers as Muníf Pasha, statesman and scholar; Ekrem Bey,
literato and professor; Kemál Bey held by some to be the greatest
writer in modern Osmanli-land and Abd al-Hakk Hamíd Bey, first
Secretary of the London Embassy. The theatre began in its
ruder form by taking subjects bodily from The Nights; then it
annexed its plays as we do—the Novel having ousted the Drama—from
the French; and lastly it took courage to be original.
Many years ago I saw Harun al-Rashid and the Three Kalandars,
with deer-skins and all their properties de rigueur, in the courtyard
of Government House, Damascus, declaiming to the extreme
astonishment and delight of the audience. It requires only to
glance at The Nights for seeing how much histrionic matter they
contain.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering the style of The Nights we must bear in mind
that the work has never been edited according to our ideas of the
process. Consequently there is no just reason for translating the
whole <span lang="la">verbatim et literatim</span>, as has been done by Torrens, Lane
and Payne in his “Tales from the Arabic.”<a id='r305' href='#f305' class='c016'><sup>[305]</sup></a> This conscientious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>treatment is required for versions of an author like Camoens
whose works were carefully corrected and arranged by a competent
littérateur, but it is not merited by The Nights as they
now are. The Macnaghten, the Bulak and the Bayrut texts,
though printed from MSS. identical in order, often differ in minor
matters. Many friends have asked me to undertake the work:
but, even if lightened by the aid of Shaykhs, Munshis and
copyists, the labour would be severe, tedious and thankless:
better leave the holes open than patch them with fancy work
or with heterogeneous matter. The learned, indeed, as Lane
tells us (i. 74; iii. 740), being thoroughly dissatisfied with the
plain and popular, the ordinary and “vulgar” note of the
language, have attempted to refine and improve it and have more
than once threatened to remodel it, that is, to make it odious.
This would be to dress up Robert Burns in plumes borrowed
from Dryden and Pope.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first defect of the texts is in the distribution and arrangement
of the matter, as I have noticed in the case of Sindbad the
Seaman (vol. vi. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54525/54525-h/54525-h.htm#Page_77">77</a>). Moreover, many of the earlier Nights are
overlong and not a few of the others are overshort: this, however,
has the prime recommendation of variety. Even the vagaries
of editor and scribe will not account for all the incoherences,
disorder and inconsequence, and for the vain iterations which
suggest that the author has forgotten what he said. In places
there are dead allusions to persons and tales which are left dark,
<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> vol. i. pp. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_43">43</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_57">57</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_61">61</a>, etc. The digressions are abrupt and
useless, leading nowhere, while sundry pages are wearisome for
excess of prolixity or hardly intelligible for extreme conciseness.
The perpetual recurrence of mean colloquialisms and of words
and idioms peculiar to Egypt and Syria<a id='r306' href='#f306' class='c016'><sup>[306]</sup></a> also takes from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>pleasure of the perusal. Yet we cannot deny that it has its
use: this unadorned language of familiar conversation in its day,
adapted for the understanding of the people, is best fitted for the
Rawi’s craft in the camp and caravan, the Harem, the bazar and
the coffee-house. Moreover, as has been well said, The Nights
is the only written half-way house between the literary and
colloquial Arabic which is accessible to all, and thus it becomes
necessary to the students who would qualify themselves for
service in Moslem lands from Mauritania to Mesopotamia. It
freely uses Turkish words like “Khátún” and Persian terms
as “Sháhbandar,” thus requiring for translation not only a
somewhat archaic touch, but also a vocabulary borrowed from
various sources: otherwise the effect would not be reproduced.
In places, however, the style rises to the highly ornate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>approaching the pompous; <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> the Wazirial addresses in
the tale of King Jali’ad. The battle-scenes, mostly admirable
(vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_365">365</a>), are told with the conciseness of a despatch and
the vividness of an artist; the two combining to form perfect
“word-pictures.” Of the Badí’a or euphuistic style, “parleying
euphuism,” and of Al-Saj’a, the prose rhyme, I shall speak in
a future page.</p>

<p class='c000'>The characteristics of the whole are naïveté and simplicity,
clearness and a singular concision. The gorgeousness is in the
imagery not in the language; the words are weak while the sense,
as in the classical Scandínavian books, is strong; and here the
Arabic differs diametrically from the florid exuberance and
turgid amplifications of the Persian story-teller, which sound so
hollow and unreal by the side of a chaster model. It abounds
in formulæ such as repetitions of religious phrases which are
unchangeable. There are certain stock comparisons, as Lokman’s
wisdom, Joseph’s beauty, Jacob’s grief, Job’s patience, David’s
music, and Maryam the Virgin’s chastity. The eyebrow is a Nún;
the eye a Sád, the mouth a Mím. A hero is more prudent than
the crow, a better guide than the Katá grouse, more generous than
the cock, warier than the crane, braver than the lion, more
aggressive than the panther, finer-sighted than the horse, craftier
than the fox, greedier than the gazelle, more vigilant than the
dog, and thriftier than the ant. The cup-boy is a sun rising
from the dark underworld symbolised by his collar; his cheek-mole
is a crumb of ambergris, his nose is a scymitar grided at the
curve; his lower lip is a jujube; his teeth are the Pleiades, or hailstones;
his browlocks are scorpions; his young hair on the upper
lip is an emerald; his side beard is a swarm of ants or a Lám
(l-letter) enclosing the roses or anemones of his cheek. The cup-girl
is a moon who rivals the sheen of the sun; her forehead is a
pearl set off by the jet of her “idiot-fringe;” her eyelashes scorn
the sharp sword; and her glances are arrows shot from the bow of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the eyebrows. A mistress necessarily belongs, though living in
the next street, to the Wady Liwá and to a hostile clan of
Badawin whose blades are ever thirsting for the lover’s blood and
whose malignant tongues aim only at the “defilement of separation.”
Youth is upright as an Alif, or slender and bending as a
branch of the Bán-tree which we should call a willow-wand,<a id='r307' href='#f307' class='c016'><sup>[307]</sup></a>
while Age, crabbed and crooked, bends groundwards vainly
seeking in the dust his lost juvenility. As Baron de Slane says
of these stock comparisons (Ibn Khall. i. xxxvi.), “The figurative
language of Moslem poets is often difficult to be understood.
The <em>narcissus</em> is the eye; the <em>feeble</em> stem of that plant bends
<em>languidly</em> under its flower, and thus recalls to mind the languor
of the eyes. <em>Pearls</em> signify both <em>tears</em> and <em>teeth</em>; the latter are
sometimes called <em>hailstones</em>, from their whiteness and moisture;
the <em>lips</em> are <em>cornelians</em> or <em>rubies</em>; the <em>gums</em>, a <em>pomegranate flower</em>;
the dark <em>foliage</em> of the <em>myrtle</em> is synonymous with the <em>black hair</em>
of the beloved, or with the first down on the cheeks of puberty.
The <em>down</em> itself is called the <em>izâr</em>, or head-stall of the bridle, and
the curve of the izar is compared to the letters lâm (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ل</span>) and nûn
(<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ن</span>).<a id='r308' href='#f308' class='c016'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Ringlets trace on the cheek
or neck the letter Wâw (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">و</span>);
they are called <em>Scorpions</em> (as the Greek <span lang="grc">σκορπίος</span>), either from their
dark colour or their agitated movements; the <em>eye</em> is a <em>sword</em>;
the <em>eyelids scabbards</em>; the <em>whiteness</em> of the complexion, <em>camphor</em>;
and a <em>mole</em> or <em>beauty-spot</em>, <em>musk</em>, which term denotes also <em>dark
hair</em>. A <em>mole</em> is sometimes compared also to an <em>ant</em> creeping on
the cheek towards the <em>honey</em> of the mouth; a <em>handsome face</em> is
both a <em>full moon</em> and <em>day</em>; <em>black hair</em> is <em>night</em>; the <em>waist</em> is a
<em>willow-branch</em> or a <em>lance</em>; the <em>water of the face</em> is <em>self-respect</em>: a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>poet <em>sells the water of his face</em><a id='r309' href='#f309' class='c016'><sup>[309]</sup></a> when he bestows mercenary praises
on a rich patron.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This does not sound promising: yet, as has been said of Arab
music, the persistent repetition of the same notes in the minor key
is by no means monotonous and ends with haunting the ear,
occupying the thought and touching the soul. Like the distant
frog-concert and chirp of the cicada, the creak of the water-wheel
and the stroke of hammers upon the anvil from afar, the murmur
of the fountain, the sough of the wind and the plash of the
wavelet, they occupy the sensorium with a soothing effect, forming
a barbaric music full of sweetness and peaceful pleasure.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'>§ IV.<br > SOCIAL CONDITION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I here propose to treat of the Social Condition which The
Nights discloses, of Al-Islam at the earlier period of its development,
concerning the position of women and about the pornology
of the great Saga-book.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>A.—<span class='sc'>Al-Islam.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A splendid and glorious life was that of Baghdad in the days
of the mighty Caliph,<a id='r310' href='#f310' class='c016'><sup>[310]</sup></a> when the Capital had towered to the
zenith of grandeur and was already trembling and tottering to
the fall. The centre of human civilization, which was then confined
to Greece and Arabia, and the metropolis of an Empire
exceeding in extent the widest limits of Rome, it was essentially
a city of pleasure, a Paris of the ixth century. The “Palace
of Peace” (Dár al-Salám), worthy successor of Babylon and
Nineveh, which had outrivalled Damascus, the “Smile of the
Prophet,” and Kufah, the successor of Hira and the magnificent
creation of Caliph Omar, possessed unrivalled advantages of
site and climate. The Tigris-Euphrates Valley, where the fabled
Garden of Eden has been placed, in early ages succeeded the
Nile-Valley as a great centre of human development; and the
prerogative of a central and commanding position still promises
it, even in the present state of decay and desolation under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>unspeakable Turk, a magnificent future,<a id='r311' href='#f311' class='c016'><sup>[311]</sup></a> when railways and
canals shall connect it with Europe. The city of palaces and
government offices, hotels and pavilions, mosques and colleges,
kiosks and squares, bazars and markets, pleasure grounds and
orchards, adorned with all the graceful charms which Saracenic
architecture had borrowed from the Byzantines, lay couched upon
the banks of the Dijlah-Hiddekel under a sky of marvellous
purity and in a climate which makes mere life a “Kayf”—the
luxury of tranquil enjoyment. It was surrounded by far-extending
suburbs, like Rusáfah on the Eastern side and
villages like Baturanjah, dear to the votaries of pleasure; and
with the roar of a gigantic capital mingled the hum of prayer,
the trilling of birds, the thrilling of harp and lute, the shrilling
of pipes, the witching strains of the professional Almah, and
the minstrel’s lay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The population of Baghdad must have been enormous when
the smallest number of her sons who fell victims to Huláku
Khan in 1258 was estimated at eight hundred thousand, while
other authorities more than double the terrible “butcher’s bill.”
Her policy and polity were unique. A well-regulated routine
of tribute and taxation, personally inspected by the Caliph; a
network of waterways, <span lang="fr">canaux d’arrosage</span>; a noble system of
highways, provided with viaducts, bridges and caravanserais,
and a postal service of mounted couriers enabled it to collect
as in a reservoir the wealth of the outer world. The facilities
for education were upon the most extended scale; large sums,
from private as well as public sources, were allotted to Mosques,
each of which, by the admirable rule of Al-Islam, was expected
to contain a school: these establishments were richly endowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>and stocked with professors collected from every land between
Khorasan and Marocco<a id='r312' href='#f312' class='c016'><sup>[312]</sup></a>; and immense libraries<a id='r313' href='#f313' class='c016'><sup>[313]</sup></a> attracted the
learned of all nations. It was a golden age for poets and
panegyrists, koranists and literati, preachers and rhetoricians,
physicians and scientists who, besides receiving high salaries and
fabulous presents, were treated with all the honours of Chinese
Mandarins; and, like these, the humblest Moslem—fisherman or
artizan—could aspire through knowledge or <span lang="fr">savoir faire</span> to the
highest offices of the Empire. The effect was a grafting of
Egyptian, and old Mesopotamian, of Persian and Græco-Latin
fruits, by long Time deteriorated, upon the strong young stock
of Arab genius; and the result, as usual after such imping, was a
shoot of exceptional luxuriance and vitality. The educational
establishments devoted themselves to the three main objects recognized
by the Moslem world, Theology, Civil Law and Belles
Lettres; and a multitude of trained Councillors enabled the ruling
powers to establish and enlarge that complicated machinery of
government, at once concentrated and decentralized, a despotism
often fatal to the wealthy great but never neglecting the interests
of the humbler lieges, which forms the beau idéal of Oriental
administration. Under the Chancellors of the empire the Kazis
administered law and order, justice and equity; and from their
decisions the poorest subject, Moslem or miscreant, could claim
with the general approval of the lieges, access and appeal to the
Caliph who, as Imám or Antistes of the Faith was High President
of a Court of Cassation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under wise administration Agriculture and Commerce, the twin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>pillars of national prosperity, necessarily flourished. A scientific
canalisation, with irrigation-works inherited from the ancients, made
the Mesopotamian Valley a rival of Kemi the Black Land, and
rendered cultivation a certainty of profit, not a mere speculation
as it must ever be to those who perforce rely upon the fickle rains
of Heaven. The remains of extensive mines prove that this
source of public wealth was not neglected; navigation laws encouraged
transit and traffic; and ordinances for the fisheries
aimed at developing a branch of industry which is still backward
even during the xixth century. Most substantial encouragement
was given to trade and commerce, to manufactures and
handicrafts, by the flood of gold which poured in from all parts
of earth; by the presence of a splendid and luxurious court,
and by the call for new arts and industries which such a civilization
would necessitate. The crafts were distributed into guilds
and syndicates under their respective chiefs, whom the government
did not “govern too much”: these Shahbandars, Mukaddams
and Nakíbs regulated the several trades, rewarded the
industrious, punished the fraudulent and were personally answerable,
as we still see at Cairo, for the conduct of their constituents.
Public order, the sine quâ non of stability and progress, was
preserved first, by the satisfaction of the lieges who, despite
their characteristic turbulence, had few if any grievances; and,
secondly, by a well-directed and efficient police, an engine of
state-craft which in the West seems most difficult to perfect. In
the East, however, the Wali or Chief Commissioner can reckon
more or less upon the unsalaried assistance of society: the cities
are divided into quarters shut off one from other by night, and
every Moslem is expected, by his law and religion, to keep watch
upon his neighbours, to report their delinquencies and, if necessary,
himself to carry out the penal code. But in difficult cases the
guardians of the peace were assisted by a body of private
detectives, women as well as men: these were called Tawwábún
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>= the Penitents, because like our Bow-street runners, they had
given up an even less respectable calling. Their adventures still
delight the vulgar, as did the Newgate Calendar of past generations;
and to this class we owe the Tales of Calamity Ahmad,
Dalilah the Wily One, Saladin with the three Chiefs of Police
(vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_271">271</a>), and Al-Malik al-Záhir with the Sixteen Constables
(Bresl. Edit. xi. pp. 321–99). Here and in many other places we
also see the origin of that “picaresque” literature which arose in
Spain and overran Europe; and which begat <span lang="fr">Le Moyen de
Parvenir</span>.<a id='r314' href='#f314' class='c016'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I need say no more on this heading, the civilisation of Baghdad
contrasting with the barbarism of Europe then Germanic, The
Nights itself being the best expositor. On the other hand the
action of the state-religion upon the state, the condition of Al-Islam
during the reign of Al-Rashid, its declension from the
primitive creed and its relation to Christianity and Christendom,
require a somewhat extended notice. In offering the following
observations it is only fair to declare my standpoints.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. All forms of “faith,” that is, belief in things unseen, not
subject to the senses and therefore unknown and (in our present
stage of development) unknowable, are temporary and transitory;
no religion hitherto promulgated amongst men shows any prospect
of being final or otherwise than finite.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Religious ideas, which are necessarily limited, may all be
traced home to the old seat of science and art, creeds and
polity in the Nile-valley and to this day they retain the clearest
signs of their origin.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. All so-called “revealed” religions consist mainly of three
portions, a cosmogony more or less mythical, a history more or
less falsified and a moral code more or less pure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Al-Islam, it has been said, is essentially a fighting faith and
never shows to full advantage save in the field. The exceeding
luxury of a wealthy capital, the debauchery and variety of vices
which would spring up therein, naturally as weeds in a rich fallow,
and the cosmopolitan views which suggest themselves in a
meeting-place of nations, were sore trials to the primitive
simplicity of the “Religion of Resignation”—the saving faith.
Harun and his cousin-wife, as has been shown, were orthodox and
even fanatical; but the Barmecides were strongly suspected of
heretical leanings; and while the many-headed showed itself, as
usual, violent, and ready to do battle about an Azan-call, the
learned, who sooner or later leaven the masses, were profoundly
dissatisfied with the dryness and barrenness of Mohammed’s creed,
so acceptable to the vulgar, and were devising a series of schisms
and innovations.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Tale of Tawaddud (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_189">189</a>) the reader has seen a
fairly extended catechism of the Creed (Dín), the ceremonial
observances (Mazhab) and the apostolic practices (Sunnat) of the
Shafi’í school which, with minor modifications, applies to the
other three orthodox. Europe has by this time clean forgotten
some tricks of her former bigotry, such as “Mawmet” (an idol!)
and “Mahommerie” (mummery<a id='r315' href='#f315' class='c016'><sup>[315]</sup></a>), a place of Moslem worship:
educated men no longer speak with Ockley of the “great impostor
Mahomet,” nor believe with the learned and violent Dr. Prideaux
that he was foolish and wicked enough to dispossess “certain poor
orphans, the sons of an inferior artificer” (the Banú Najjár!). A
host of books has attempted, though hardly with success, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>enlighten popular ignorance upon a crucial point; namely, that
the Founder of Al-Islam, like the Founder of Christianity, never
pretended to establish a new religion. His claims, indeed, were
limited to purging the “School of Nazareth” of the dross of ages
and of the manifold abuses with which long use had infected
its early constitution: hence to the unprejudiced observer his
reformation seems to have brought it nearer the primitive and
original doctrine than any subsequent attempts, especially the
Judaizing tendencies of the so-called “Protestant” churches. The
Meccan Apostle preached that the Hanafíyyah or orthodox belief,
which he subsequently named Al-Islam, was first taught by Allah,
in all its purity and perfection, to Adam and consigned to certain
inspired volumes now lost; and that this primal Holy Writ
received additions in the days of his descendants Shís (Seth) and
Idris (Enoch?), the founder of the Sabian (not “Sabæan”) faith.
Here, therefore, Al-Islam at once avoided the deplorable assumption
of the Hebrews and the Christians,—an error which has been
so injurious to their science and their progress,—of placing their
“first man” in circa B.C. 4000 or somewhat subsequent to the
building of the Pyramids: the Pre-Adamite<a id='r316' href='#f316' class='c016'><sup>[316]</sup></a> races and dynasties
of the Moslems remove a great stumbling-block and square with
the anthropological views of the present day. In process of time,
when the Adamite religion demanded a restoration and a supplement,
its pristine virtue was revived, restored and further developed
by the books communicated to Abraham, whose dispensation thus
takes the place of the Hebrew Noah and his Noachidæ. In due
time the Torah, or Pentateuch, superseded and abrogated the
Abrahamic dispensation; the “Zabúr” of David (a book not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>confined to the Psalms) reformed the Torah; the Injíl or Evangel
reformed the Zabur and was itself purified, quickened and perfected
by the Koran which means <span lang="grc">κατ’ἐξοχήν</span> the Reading or the
Recital. Hence Locke, with many others, held Moslems to be
unorthodox, that is anti-Trinitarian Christians who believe in the
immaculate Conception, in the Ascension and in the divine
mission of Jesus; and when Priestley affirmed that “Jesus was
sent from God,” all Moslems do the same. Thus they are, in the
main point of doctrine connected with the Deity, simply Arians as
opposed to Athanasians. History proves that the former was the
earlier faith which, though formally condemned in A.D. 325 by
Constantine’s Council of Nice,<a id='r317' href='#f317' class='c016'><sup>[317]</sup></a> overspread the Orient beginning
with Eastern Europe, where Ulphilas converted the Goths; which
extended into Africa with the Vandals, claimed a victim or martyr
as late as in the sixteenth century<a id='r318' href='#f318' class='c016'><sup>[318]</sup></a> and has by no means died
out in this our day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Talmud had been completed a full century before
Mohammed’s time and the Evangel had been translated into
Arabic; moreover travel and converse with his Jewish and
Christian friends and companions must have convinced the
Meccan apostle that Christianity was calling as loudly for reform
as Judaism had done.<a id='r319' href='#f319' class='c016'><sup>[319]</sup></a> An exaggerated Trinitarianism or rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Tritheism, a “Fourth Person” and Saint-worship had virtually
dethroned the Deity; whilst Mariolatry had made the faith a religio
muliebris, and superstition had drawn from its horrid fecundity
an incredible number of heresies and monstrous absurdities.
Even ecclesiastic writers draw the gloomiest pictures of the
Christian Church in the fourth and seventh centuries, and one
declares that the “Kingdom of Heaven had become a Hell.”
Egypt, distracted by the blood-thirsty religious wars of Copt and
Greek, had been covered with hermitages by a <span lang="la">gens æterna</span> of
semi-maniacal superstition. Syria, ever “feracious of heresies,”
had allowed many of her finest tracts to be monopolised by
monkeries and nunneries.<a id='r320' href='#f320' class='c016'><sup>[320]</sup></a> After many a tentative measure
Mohammed seems to have built his edifice upon two bases, the
unity of the Godhead and the priesthood of the paterfamilias.
He abolished for ever the “<span lang="la">sacerdos alter Christus</span>” whose
existence, as some one acutely said, is the best proof of
Christianity, and whom all know to be its weakest point. The
Moslem family, however humble, was to be the model in miniature
of the State, and every father in Al-Islam was made priest and
pontiff in his own house, able unaided to marry himself, to circumcise
(to baptise as it were) his children, to instruct them in the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and canonically to bury himself (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_22">22</a>). Ritual, properly so
called, there was none; congregational prayers were merely those
of the individual <span lang="fr">en masse</span> and the only admitted approach to a
sacerdotal order were the Olema or scholars learned in the legistic
and the Mullah or schoolmaster. By thus abolishing the priesthood
Mohammed reconciled ancient with modern wisdom. “<span lang="la">Scito
dominum</span>,” said Cato, “<span lang="la">pro totâ familiâ rem divinam facere</span>”: “No
priest at a birth, no priest at a marriage, no priest at a death,” is
the aspiration of the present Rationalistic School.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Meccan apostle wisely retained the compulsory sacrament
of circumcision and the ceremonial ablutions of the Mosaic law; and
the five daily prayers not only diverted man’s thoughts from the
world but tended to keep his body pure. These two institutions
had been practised throughout life by the Founder of Christianity;
but the followers who had never even seen him, abolished them for
purposes evidently political and propagandist. By ignoring the
truth that cleanliness is next to godliness they paved the way for
such saints as Simon Stylites and Sabba who, like the lowest
Hindu orders of ascetics, made filth a concominant and an
evidence of piety: even now English Catholic girls are at times
forbidden by Italian priests a frequent use of the bath as a signpost
to the sin of “luxury.” Mohammed would have accepted
the morals contained in the Sermon on the Mount much more
readily than did the Jews from whom its matter was borrowed.<a id='r321' href='#f321' class='c016'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
He did something to abolish the use of wine, which in the East
means only its abuse; and he denounced games of chance, well
knowing that the excitable races of sub-tropical climates cannot
play with patience, fairness or moderation. He set aside certain
sums for charity to be paid by every Believer and he was the first to
establish a poor-rate (Zakát): thus he avoided the shame and
scandal of mendicancy which, beginning in the Catholic countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of Southern Europe, extends to Syria and as far East as
Christianity is found. By these and other measures of the same
import he made the ideal Moslem’s life physically clean, moderate
and temperate.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Mohammed the “master mind of the age,” had, we must
own, a “genuine prophetic power, a sinking of self in the Divine,
not distinguishable in kind from the inspiration of the Hebrew
prophets,” especially in that puritanical and pharisaic narrowness
which, with characteristic simplicity, can see no good outside its
own petty pale. He had insight as well as outsight, and the two
taught him that personal and external reformation were mean
matters compared with elevating the inner man. In the “purer
Faith,” which he was commissioned to abrogate and to quicken,
he found two vital defects equally fatal to its energy and to its
longevity. These were (and are) its egoism and its degradation
of humanity. Thus it cannot be a “pleroma”: it needs a Higher
Law.<a id='r322' href='#f322' class='c016'><sup>[322]</sup></a> As Judaism promised the good Jew all manner of temporal
blessings, issue, riches, wealth, honour, power, length of days, so
Christianity offered the good Christian, as a bribe to lead a godly
life, personal salvation and a future state of happiness, in fact,
the Kingdom of Heaven, with an alternative threat of Hell. It
never rose to the height of the Hindu Brahmans and Lao-Tse (the
“Ancient Teacher”); of Zeno the Stoic and his disciples the noble
Pharisees<a id='r323' href='#f323' class='c016'><sup>[323]</sup></a> who believed and preached that Virtue is its own
reward. It never dared to say, “Do good for Good’s sake<a id='r324' href='#f324' class='c016'><sup>[324]</sup></a>;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>even now it does not declare with Cicero, “The sum of all is that
what is right, should be sought for its own sake, because it is right,
and not because it is enacted.” It does not even now venture to
say with Philo Judæus, “The good man seeks the day for the sake
of the day, and the light for the light’s sake; and he labours to
acquire what is good for the sake of the good itself, and not of
anything else.” So far for the egotism, naïve and unconscious,
of Christianity, whose burden is, “Do good to escape Hell and
gain Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A no less defect in the “School of Galilee” is its low view of
human nature. Adopting as sober and authentic history an
Osirian-Hebrew myth which Philo and a host of Rabbis explain
away, each after his own fashion, Christianity dwells, lovingly as it
were, upon the “Fall” of man<a id='r325' href='#f325' class='c016'><sup>[325]</sup></a> and seems to revel in the contemptible
condition to which “original sin” condemned him;
thus grovelling before God ad majorem Dei gloriam. To such a
point was and is this carried that the Synod of Dort declared,
<span lang="la">Infantes infidelium morientes in infantiâ reprobatos esse statuimus</span>;
nay, many of the orthodox still hold a Christian babe dying unbaptised
to be unfit for a higher existence, and some have
even created a “limbo” expressly to domicile the innocents “of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>whom is the kingdom of Heaven.” Here, if any where, the cloven
foot shows itself and teaches us that the only solid stratum
underlying priestcraft is one composed of £ s. d.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus Christianity, admitting, like Judaism, its own saints and
santons, utterly ignores the progress of humanity, perhaps the only
belief in which the wise man can take unmingled satisfaction.
Both have proposed an originally perfect being with hyacinthine
locks, from whose type all the subsequent humans are degradations
physical and moral. We on the other hand hold, from the
evidence of our senses, that early man was a savage very little
superior to the brute; that during man’s millions of years upon
earth there has been a gradual advance towards perfection, at
times irregular and even retrograde, but in the main progressive;
and that a comparison of man in the xixth century with the caveman<a id='r327' href='#f327' class='c016'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
affords us the means of measuring past progress and of
calculating the future of humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Mahommed was far from rising to the moral heights of the
ancient sages: he did nothing to abate the egotism of Christianity;
he even exaggerated the pleasures of its Heaven and the horrors
of its Hell. On the other hand he did much to exalt human
nature. He passed over the “Fall” with a light hand; he made
man superior to the angels: he encouraged his fellow-creatures to
be great and good by dwelling upon their nobler not their meaner
side; he acknowledged, even in this world, the perfectability of
mankind, including womankind, and in proposing the loftiest
ideal he acted unconsciously upon the grand dictum of chivalry—<span lang="fr">Honneur
oblige</span>.<a id='r328' href='#f328' class='c016'><sup>[328]</sup></a> His prophets were mostly faultless men; and,
if the “Pure of Allah” sinned, he “sinned against himself.”
Lastly, he made Allah predetermine the career and fortunes, not
only of empires, but of every created being; thus inculcating
sympathy and tolerance of others, which is true humanity, and a
proud resignation to evil as to good fortune. This is the doctrine
which teaches the vulgar Moslem a dignity observed even by the
“blind traveller,” and which enables him to display a moderation,
a fortitude, and a self-command rare enough amongst the followers
of the “purer creed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Christian historians explain variously the portentous rise of Al-Islam
and its marvellous spread over vast regions, not only of
pagans and idolators but of Christians. Prideaux disingenuously
suggests that it “seems to have been purposely raised up by
God, to be a scourge to the Christian church for not living in
accordance with their most holy religion.” The popular excuse is
by the free use of the sword; this, however, is mere ignorance:
in Mohammed’s day and early Al-Islam only actual fighters were
slain<a id='r329' href='#f329' class='c016'><sup>[329]</sup></a>: the rest were allowed to pay the Jizyah, or capitation-tax,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and to become tributaries, enjoying almost all the privileges
of Moslems. But even had forcible conversion been most
systematically practised, it would have afforded an insufficient
explanation of the phenomenal rise of an empire which covered
more ground in eighty years than Rome had gained in eight
hundred. During so short a time the grand revival of Monotheism
had consolidated into a mighty nation, despite their eternal blood-feuds,
the scattered Arab tribes; a six-years’ campaign had conquered
Syria, and a lustre or two utterly overthrew Persia, humbled
the Græco-Roman, subdued Egypt and extended the Faith along
northern Africa as far as the Atlantic. Within three generations
the Copts of Nile-land had formally cast out Christianity, and the
same was the case with Syria, the cradle of the Nazarene, and
Mesopotamia, one of his strongholds, although both were backed
by all the remaining power of the Byzantine empire. Northwestern
Africa, which had rejected the idolatro-philosophic system
of pagan and imperial Rome, and had accepted, after lukewarm
fashion, the Arian Christianity imported by the Vandals, and the
“Nicene mystery of the Trinity,” hailed with enthusiasm the
doctrines of the Koran and has never ceased to be most zealous
in its Islam. And while Mohammedanism speedily reduced the
limits of Christendom by one-third, while throughout the Arabian,
Saracenic and Turkish invasions whole Christian peoples embraced
the monotheistic faith, there are hardly any instances of defection
from the new creed and, with the exception of Spain and Sicily,
it has never been suppressed in any land where once it took root.
Even now, when Mohammedanism no longer wields the sword, it is
spreading over wide regions in China, in the Indian Archipelago,
and especially in Western and Central Africa, propagated only
by self-educated individuals, trading travellers, while Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>makes no progress and cannot exist on the Dark Continent
without strong support from Government. Nor can we explain
this honourable reception by the “licentiousness” ignorantly
attributed to Al-Islam, one of the most severely moral of institutions;
or by the allurements of polygamy and concubinage, slavery,<a id='r330' href='#f330' class='c016'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
and a “wholly sensual Paradise” devoted to eating, drinking<a id='r331' href='#f331' class='c016'><sup>[331]</sup></a> and
the pleasures of the sixth sense. The true and simple explanation
is that this grand Reformation of Christianity was urgently wanted
when it appeared, that it suited the people better than the creed
which it superseded and that it has not ceased to be sufficient for
their requirements, social, sexual and vital. As the practical
Orientalist, Dr. Leitner, well observes from his own experience,
“The Mohammedan religion can adapt itself better than any
other and has adapted itself to circumstances and to the needs
of the various races which profess it, in accordance with the
spirit of the age.”<a id='r332' href='#f332' class='c016'><sup>[332]</sup></a> Hence, I add, its wide diffusion and its
impregnable position. “The dead hand, stiff and motionless”
is a forcible simile for the present condition of Al-Islam; but it
results from limited and imperfect observation and it fails in the
sine quâ non of similes and metaphors, a foundation of fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot quit this subject without a passing reference to an
admirably written passage in Mr. Palgrave’s travels<a id='r333' href='#f333' class='c016'><sup>[333]</sup></a> which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>essentially unfair to Al-Islam. The author has had ample
opportunities of comparing creeds: of Jewish blood and born a
Protestant, he became a Catholic and a Jesuit (Père Michel Cohen)<a id='r334' href='#f334' class='c016'><sup>[334]</sup></a>
in a Syrian convent; he crossed Arabia as a good Moslem and
he finally returned to his premier amour, Anglicanism. But his
picturesque depreciation of Mohammedanism, which has found due
appreciation in more than one popular volume,<a id='r335' href='#f335' class='c016'><sup>[335]</sup></a> is a notable
specimen of special pleading, of the ad captandum in its modern
and least honest form. The writer begins by assuming the arid
and barren Wahhabi-ism, which he had personally studied, as a
fair expression of the Saving Faith. What should we say to a
Moslem traveller who would make the Calvinism of the sourest
Covenanter, model, genuine and ancient Christianity? What would
sensible Moslems say to these propositions of Professor Maccovius
and the Synod of Dort:—Good works are an obstacle to salvation.
God does by no means will the salvation of all men: he does will
sin and he destines men to sin, as sin? What would they think
of the Inadmissible Grace, the Perseverance of the Elect, the
Supralapsarian and the Sublapsarian and, finally, of a Deity the
author of man’s existence, temptation and fall, who deliberately
pre-ordains sin and ruin? “Father Cohen” carries out into the
regions of the extreme his strictures on the one grand vitalising
idea of Al-Islam, “There is no god but God”;<a id='r336' href='#f336' class='c016'><sup>[336]</sup></a> and his deduction
concerning the Pantheism of Force sounds unreal and unsound,
compared with the sensible remarks upon the same subject by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Dr. Badger<a id='r337' href='#f337' class='c016'><sup>[337]</sup></a> who sees the abstruseness of the doctrine and does
not care to include it in hard and fast lines or to subject it to
mere logical analysis. Upon the subject of “predestination”
Mr. Palgrave quotes, not from the Koran, but from the Ahádís or
Traditional Sayings of the Apostle; but what importance attaches
to a legend in the Mischnah, or Oral Law, of the Hebrews utterly
ignored by the Written Law? He joins the many in complaining
that even the mention of “the love of God” is absent from
Mohammed’s theology, burking the fact that it never occurs in the
Jewish scriptures and that the genius of Arabic, like Hebrew, does
not admit the expression: worse still, he keeps from his reader
such Koranic passages as, to quote no other, “Allah loveth you
and will forgive your sins” (iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_29">29</a>). He pities Allah for having
“no son, companion or counsellor” and, of course, he must
equally commiserate Jehovah. Finally his views of the lifelessness
of Al-Islam are directly opposed to the opinions of Dr.
Leitner and the experience of all who have lived in Moslem lands.
Such are the ingenious but not ingenuous distortions of fact, the
fine instances of the pathetic fallacy, and the noteworthy illustrations
of the falsehood of extremes, which have engendered
“Mohammedanism a Relapse: the worst form of Monotheism,”<a id='r338' href='#f338' class='c016'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and which have been eagerly seized upon and further deformed
by the authors of popular books, that is, volumes written by those
who know little for those who know less.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Al-Rashid’s day a mighty change had passed over the
primitive simplicity of Al-Islam, the change to which faiths and
creeds, like races and empires and all things sublunary, are
subject. The proximity of Persia and the close intercourse
with the Græco-Romans had polished and greatly modified the
physiognomy of the rugged old belief: all manner of metaphysical
subtleties had cropped up, with the usual disintegrating effect, and
some of these threatened even the unity of the Godhead. Musaylimah
and Karmat had left traces of their handiwork: the
Mutazilites (separatists or secessors) actively propagated their
doctrine of a created and temporal Koran. The Khárijí or Ibázi,
who rejects and reviles Abú Turáb (Caliph Ali), contended passionately
with the Shí’ah who reviles and rejects the other three
“Successors;” and these sectarians, favoured by the learned, and
by the Abbasides in their jealous hatred of the Ommiades, went
to the extreme length of the Ali-Iláhi—the God-makers of Ali—whilst
the Dahrí and the Zindík, the Mundanist and the Agnostic,
proposed to sweep away the whole edifice. The neo-Platonism
and Gnosticism which had not essentially affected Christendom,<a id='r339' href='#f339' class='c016'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
found in Al-Islam a rich fallow and gained strength and luxuriance
by the solid materialism and conservatism of its basis. Such were
a few of the distracting and resolving influences which Time had
brought to bear upon the True Believer and which, after some
half a dozen generations, had separated the several schisms by a
wider breach than that which yawns between Orthodox, Romanist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and Lutheran. Nor was this scandal in Al-Islam abated until
the Tartar sword applied to it the sharpest remedy.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>B.—<span class='sc'>Woman.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The next point I propose to consider is the position of womanhood
in The Nights, so curiously at variance with the stock ideas
concerning the Moslem home and domestic policy still prevalent,
not only in England, but throughout Europe. Many readers of
these volumes have remarked to me with much astonishment that
they find the female characters more remarkable for decision,
action and manliness than the male; and are wonderstruck by their
masterful attitude and by the supreme influence they exercise
upon public and private life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have glanced at the subject of the sex in Al-Islam to such an
extent throughout my notes that little remains here to be added.
Women, all the world over, are what men make them; and the
main charm of Amazonian fiction is to see how they live and
move and have their being without any masculine guidance.
But it is the old ever-new fable</p>

<p class='c000'>The books of the Ancients, written in that stage of civilisation,
when the sexes are at civil war, make women even more than
in real life the creatures of their masters: hence from the dawn
of literature to the present day the sex has been the subject
of disappointed abuse and eulogy almost as unmerited. Ecclesiastes,
perhaps the strangest specimen of an “inspired volume”
the world has yet produced, boldly declares “One (upright) man
among a thousand I have found; but a woman among all have I
not found” (vol. vii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54778/54778-h/54778-h.htm#Page_28">28</a>), thus confirming the pessimism of

insatiables, Hell, Earth and the Parts feminine (<i><span lang="la">os vulvæ</span></i>); and
Rabbinical learning has embroidered these and other texts, producing
a truly hideous caricature. A Hadis attributed to
Mohammed runs, “They (women) lack wits and faith. When
Eve was created Satan rejoiced saying:—Thou art half of my
host, the trustee of my secret and my shaft wherewith I shoot and
miss not!” Another tells us, “I stood at the gate of Heaven,

of Hell, and lo! most of its inmates were women.”<a id='r340' href='#f340' class='c016'><sup>[340]</sup></a> “Take care
of the glass-phials!” cried the Prophet to a camel-guide singing
with a sweet voice. Yet the Meccan apostle made, as has been
seen, his own household produce two perfections. The blatant
popular voice follows with such “dictes” as, “Women are made of
nectar and poison”; “Women have long hair and short wits”
and so forth. Nor are the Hindus behind hand. Woman has
fickleness implanted in her by Nature like the flashings of lightning
(Kathá s.s. i. 147); she is valueless as a straw to the heroic mind
(169); she is hard as adamant in sin and soft as flour in fear
(170) and, like the fly, she quits camphor to settle on compost
(ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_17">17</a>). “What dependence is there in the crowing of a hen?”
(women’s opinions) says the Hindi proverb; also “A virgin with
grey hairs!” (<i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> a monster) and, “Wherever wendeth a fairy face
a devil wendeth with her.” The same superficial view of holding
woman to be lesser (and very inferior) man is taken generally by
the classics; and Euripides distinguished himself by misogyny,
although he drew the beautiful character of Alcestis. Simonides,
more merciful than Ecclesiastes, after naming his swine-women,
dog-women, cat-women, etc., ends the decade with the admirable
bee-woman thus making ten per cent. honest. In mediæval or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Germanic Europe the doctrine of the Virgin mother gave the sex a
status unknown to the ancients except in Egypt, where Isis was the
help-mate and completion of Osiris, in modern parlance “The
Woman clothed with the Sun.” The kindly and courtly Palmerin
of England, in whose pages “gentlemen may find their choice of
sweet inventions and gentlewomen be satisfied with courtly expectations,”
suddenly blurts out, “But in truth women are never
satisfied by reason, being governed by accident or appetite”
(chapt. xlix).</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nights, as might be expected from the emotional
East, exaggerate these views. Women are mostly “Sectaries
of the god Wünsch”; beings of impulse, blown about by
every gust of passion; stable only in instability; constant
only in inconstancy. The false ascetic, the perfidious and
murderous crone and the old hag-procuress who pimps like
Umm Kulsum<a id='r341' href='#f341' class='c016'><sup>[341]</sup></a>, for mere pleasure, in the luxury of sin, are drawn
with an experienced and loving hand. Yet not the less do we
meet with examples of the dutiful daughter, the model lover
matronly in her affection, the devoted wife, the perfect mother,
the saintly devotee, the learned preacher, Univira the chaste
widow and the self-sacrificing heroic woman. If we find (vol. iii.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_216">216</a>) the sex described as:—</p>

<p class='c000'>and the studied insults of vol. iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_318">318</a>, we also come upon an
admirable sketch of conjugal happiness (vol. vii. ? 43); and, to
mention no other, Shahryar’s attestation to Shahrazad’s excellence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>in the last charming pages of The Nights.<a id='r342' href='#f342' class='c016'><sup>[342]</sup></a> It is the same with the
Kathá whose praise and dispraise are equally enthusiastic; <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>,
“Women of good family are guarded by their own virtue, the sole
efficient chamberlain; but the Lord himself can hardly guard the
unchaste. Who can stem a furious stream and a frantic woman?”
(i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_328">328</a>). “Excessive love in woman is your only hero for daring”
(i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_339">339</a>). “Thus fair ones, naturally feeble, bring about a series of evil
actions which engender discernment and aversion to the world;
but here and there you will find a virtuous woman who adorneth
a glorious house as the streak of the moon arrayeth the breadth
of the Heavens” (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_346">346</a>). “So you see, King, honourable matrons
are devoted to their husbands and ’tis not the case that women
are always bad” (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_624">624</a>). And there is true wisdom in that even
balance of feminine qualities advocated by our Hindu-Hindi
class-book the Toti-námeh or Parrot volume. The perfect woman
has seven requisites. She must not always be merry (1) nor sad
(2); she must not always be talking (3) nor silently musing (4);
she must not always be adorning herself (5) nor neglecting her
person (6); and, (7) at all times she must be moderate and self-possessed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The legal status of womankind in Al-Islam is exceptionally
high, a fact of which Europe has often been assured, although
the truth has not even yet penetrated into the popular brain.
Nearly a century ago one Mirza Abú Tálib Khán, an Amildár
or revenue collector, after living two years in London, wrote an
“apology” for, or rather a vindication of, his countrywomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>which is still worth reading and quoting.<a id='r343' href='#f343' class='c016'><sup>[343]</sup></a> Nations are but
superficial judges of one another: where customs differ they
often remark only the salient distinctive points which, when
examined, prove to be of minor importance. Europeans seeing
and hearing that women in the East are “cloistered” as the
Grecian matron was wont <span lang="grc">ἔνδον μένειν</span> and <span lang="grc">οἰκουρεῖν</span>; that wives
may not walk out with their husbands and cannot accompany
them to “balls and parties”; moreover, that they are always
liable, like the ancient Hebrew, to the mortification of the “sister-wife,”
have most ignorantly determined that they are mere serviles
and that their lives are not worth living. Indeed, a learned lady,
Miss Martineau, once visiting a Harem went into ectasies of pity
and sorrow because the poor things knew nothing of—say trigonometry
and the use of the globes. Sonnini thought otherwise,
and my experience, like that of all old dwellers in the East, is
directly opposed to this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have noted (Night cmlxii.) that Mohammed, in the fifth year
of his reign,<a id='r344' href='#f344' class='c016'><sup>[344]</sup></a> after his ill-advised and scandalous marriage<a id='r345' href='#f345' class='c016'><sup>[345]</sup></a> with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>his foster-daughter Zaynab, established the Hijáb or veiling of
women. It was probably an exaggeration of local usage: a
modified separation of the sexes, which extended and still extends
even to the Badawi, must long have been customary in Arabian
cities, and its object was to deliver the sexes from temptation, as
the Koran says (xxxii. 32), “purer will this (practice) be for your
hearts and their hearts.”<a id='r346' href='#f346' class='c016'><sup>[346]</sup></a> The women, who delight in restrictions
which tend to their honour, accepted it willingly and still affect it;
they do not desire a liberty or rather a licence which they have
learned to regard as inconsistent with their time-honoured notions
of feminine decorum and delicacy, and they would think very
meanly of a husband who permitted them to be exposed, like
hetairæ, to the public gaze.<a id='r347' href='#f347' class='c016'><sup>[347]</sup></a> As Zubayr Pasha, exiled to Gibraltar
for another’s treason, said to my friend, Colonel Buckle, after
visiting quarters evidently laid out by a jealous husband, “We
Arabs think that when a man has a precious jewel, ’tis wiser to
lock it up in a box than to leave it about for anyone to take.”
The Eastern adopts the instinctive, the Western prefers the rational
method. The former jealously guards his treasure, surrounds it
with all precautions, fends off from it all risks and if the treasure
go astray, kills it. The latter, after placing it <i><span lang="fr">en evidence</span></i> upon an
eminence in ball dress with back and bosom bared to the gaze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of society, a bundle of charms exposed to every possible seduction,
allows it to take its own way, and if it be misled, he kills or
tries to kill the misleader. It is a fiery trial; and the few who
safely pass through it may claim a higher standpoint in the moral
world than those who have never been sorely tried. But the crucial
question is whether Christian Europe has done wisely in
offering such temptations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second and main objection to Moslem custom is the marriage-system
which begins with a girl being wedded to a man
whom she knows only by hearsay. This was the habit of our
forbears not many generations ago, and it still prevails amongst
noble houses in Southern Europe, where a lengthened study of
it leaves me doubtful whether the “love-marriage,” as it is called,
or wedlock with an utter stranger, evidently the two extremes, is
likely to prove the happier. The “sister-wife” is or would be a
sore trial to monogamic races like those of Northern Europe,
where Caia, all but the equal of Caius in most points mental and
physical and superior in some, not unfrequently proves herself
the “man of the family,” the “only man in the boat.” But in the
East, where the sex is far more delicate, where a girl is brought
up in polygamy, where religious reasons separate her from her
husband, during pregnancy and lactation, for three successive
years; and where often enough like the Mormon damsel she
would hesitate to “nigger it with a one-wife-man,” the case
assumes a very different aspect and the load, if burden it be, falls
comparatively light. Lastly, the “patriarchal household” is
mostly confined to the grandee and the richard, whilst Holy Law
and public opinion, neither of which can openly be disregarded,
assign command of the household to the <em>equal</em> or first wife and
jealously guard the rights and privileges of the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mirza Abu Talib “the Persian Prince”<a id='r348' href='#f348' class='c016'><sup>[348]</sup></a> offers six reasons why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“the liberty of the Asiatic women appears less than that of the
Europeans,” ending with,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’ll fondly place on either eye</div>
      <div class='line'>The man that can to this reply.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He then lays down eight points in which the Moslem wife has
greatly the advantage over her Christian sisterhood; and we may
take his first as a specimen. Custom, not contrary to law, invests
the Mohammedan mother with despotic government of the homestead,
slaves, servants and children, especially the latter: she alone
directs their early education, their choice of faith, their marriage
and their establishment in life; and in case of divorce she takes
the daughters, the sons going to the sire. She has also liberty
to leave her home, not only for one or two nights, but for a week
or a fortnight, without consulting her husband; and whilst she
visits a strange household, the master and all males above fifteen
are forbidden the Harem. But the main point in favour of the
Moslem wife is her being a “legal sharer”: inheritance is secured
to her by Koranic law; she must be dowered by the bridegroom
to legalise marriage and all she gains is secured to her; whereas
in England a “Married Woman’s Property Act” was completed
only in 1882 after many centuries of the grossest abuses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, Moslems and Easterns in general study and intelligently
study the art and mystery of satisfying the physical woman. In
my Foreword I have noticed among barbarians the system of
“making men”<a id='r349' href='#f349' class='c016'><sup>[349]</sup></a> that is, of teaching lads first arrived at puberty
the nice conduct of the <span lang="la">instrumentum paratum plantandis civibus</span>;
a branch of the knowledge-tree which our modern education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>grossly neglects, thereby entailing untold miseries upon individuals,
families and generations. The mock virtue, the most immodest
modesty of England and of the United States in the xix<sup>th</sup> century,
pronounces the subject foul and fulsome: “Society” sickens at all
details; and hence it is said abroad that the English have the
finest women in Europe and least know how to use them.
Throughout the East such studies are aided by a long series of
volumes, many of them written by learned physiologists, by men
of social standing and by religious dignitaries high in office. The
Egyptians especially delight in aphrodisiac literature treating, as
the Turks say, <span lang="fr">de la partie au-dessous de la taille</span>; and from fifteen
hundred to two thousand copies of a new work, usually lithographed
in cheap form, readily sell off. The pudibund Lane
makes allusion to and quotes (A. N. i. 216) one of the most outspoken,
a 4to of 464 pages, called the Halbat al-Kumayt or “Race-Course
of the Bay Horse,” a poetical and horsey term for grape-wine.
Attributed by D’Herbelot to the Kazi Shams al-Din Mohammed,
it is wholly upon the subject of wassail and women till
the last few pages, when his reverence exclaims:—“This much, O
reader, I have recounted, the better thou mayst know what to
avoid;” and so forth, ending with condemning all he had praised.<a id='r350' href='#f350' class='c016'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
Even the divine and historian Jalál al-Dín al-Siyuti is credited
with having written, though the authorship is much disputed, a
work entitled, “Kitáb al-Ízáh fi ’ilm al-Nikáh” = The Book of
Exposition in the Science of Coition: my copy, a lithograph of
33 pages, undated, but evidently Cairene, begins with exclaiming
“Alhamdolillah—Laud to the Lord who adorned the virginal
bosom with breasts and who made the thighs of women anvils for
the spear-handles of men!” To the same amiable theologian are
also ascribed the “Kitáb Nawázir al-Ayk fi al-Nayk” = Green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Splendours of the Copse in Copulation, an abstract of the Kitáb
al-Wisháh fí fawáid al-Nikáh = Book of the Zone on Coitionboon.
Of the abundance of pornographic literature we may judge
from a list of the following seven works given in the second page
of the “Kitáb Rujú’a al-Shaykh ila Sabáh fi ’l-Kuwwat al-Báh”<a id='r351' href='#f351' class='c016'><sup>[351]</sup></a> =
Book of Age-rejuvenescence in the power of Concupiscence: it is
the work of Ahmad bin Sulayman, surnamed Ibn Kamál Pasha.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>To these I may add the Lizzat al-Nisá (Pleasures of Women), a
text-book in Arabic, Persian and Hindostani: it is a translation
and a very poor attempt, omitting much from, and adding naught
to, the famous Sanskrit work Ananga-Ranga (Stage of the Bodiless
One <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Cupido) or Hindu Art of Love (<span lang="la">Ars Amoris Indica</span>).<a id='r354' href='#f354' class='c016'><sup>[354]</sup></a> I
have copies of it in Sanskrit and Maráthi, Guzrati and Hindostani:
the latter is an unpaged 8vo of p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>, including eight pages of
most grotesque illustrations showing the various Ásan (the <span lang="la">Figuræ
Veneris</span> or positions of copulation), which seem to be the triumphs
of contortionists. These pamphlets lithographed in Bombay are
broad cast over the land.<a id='r355' href='#f355' class='c016'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It must not be supposed that such literature is purely and simply
aphrodisiacal. The learned Sprenger, a physician as well as an
Arabist, says (Al-Mas’údi p. 384) of a tractate by the celebrated
Rhazes in the Leyden Library “The number of curious observations,
the correct and practical ideas and the novelty of the
notions of Eastern nations on these subjects, which are contained
in this book, render it one of the most important productions of
the medical literature of the Arabs.” I can conscientiously
recommend to the Anthropologist a study of the “Kutub al-Báh.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>C.—<span class='sc'>Pornography.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Here it will be advisable to supplement what was said in my
Foreword (p. xv.) concerning the <i><span lang="la">turpiloquium</span></i> of The Nights.
Readers who have perused the ten volumes will probably agree
with me that the naïve indecencies of the text are rather <em>gaudisserie</em>
than prurience; and, when delivered with mirth and humour, they
are rather the “excrements of wit” than designed for debauching
the mind. Crude and indelicate with infantile plainness; even
gross and, at times, “nasty” in their terrible frankness, they
cannot be accused of corrupting suggestiveness or subtle insinuation
of vicious sentiment. Theirs is a coarseness of language, not
of idea; they are indecent, not depraved; and the pure and perfect
naturalness of their nudity seems almost to purify it, showing that
the matter is rather of manners than of morals. Such throughout
the East is the language of every man, woman and child, from
prince to peasant, from matron to prostitute: all are as the
naïve French traveller said of the Japanese; “<span lang="fr">si grossiers qu’ils
ne sçavent nommer les choses que par leur nom</span>.” This primitive
stage of language sufficed to draw from Lane and Burckhardt
strictures upon the “most immodest freedom of conversation in
Egypt,” where, as all the world over, there are three several
stages for names of things and acts sensual. First we have the
<i><span lang="fr">mot cru</span></i>, the popular term, soon followed by the technical and
scientific, and, lastly, the literary or figurative nomenclature, which
is often much more immoral because more attractive, suggestive
and seductive than the “raw word.” And let me observe that the
highest civilization is now returning to the language of nature. In
La Glu of M. J. Richepin, a triumph of the realistic school, we
find such “archaic” expressions as <span lang="fr">la petée, putain, foutue à la
six-quatre-dix; une<a id='t203'></a> facétieuse pétarade; tu t’es foutue de, etc.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Eh vilain bougre!</span> and so forth.<a id='r356' href='#f356' class='c016'><sup>[356]</sup></a> To those critics who complain
of these raw vulgarisms and puerile indecencies in The Nights I
can reply only by quoting the words said to have been said by
Dr. Johnson to the lady who complained of the naughty words in
his dictionary—“You must have been looking for them, Madam!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But I repeat (p. xvi.) there is another element in The Nights
and that is one of absolute obscenity utterly repugnant to English
readers, even the least prudish. It is chiefly connected with what
our neighbours call <i><span lang="fr">Le vice contre nature</span></i>—as if anything can be
contrary to nature which includes all things.<a id='r357' href='#f357' class='c016'><sup>[357]</sup></a> Upon this subject
I must offer details, as it does not enter into my plan to ignore
any theme which is interesting to the Orientalist and the Anthropologist.
And they, methinks, do abundant harm who, for shame
or disgust, would suppress the very mention of such matters: in
order to combat a great and growing evil deadly to the birth-rate—the
main-stay of national prosperity—the first requisite is careful
study. As Albert Bollstoedt, Bishop of Ratisbon, rightly says:—<span lang="la">Quia
malum non evitatum nisi cognitum, ideo necesse est cognoscere
immundiciem coitus et multa alia quæ docentur in isto
libro</span>. Equally true are Professor Mantegazza’s words:<a id='r358' href='#f358' class='c016'><sup>[358]</sup></a> <span lang="fr">Cacher
les plaies du cœur humain au nom de la pudeur, ce n’est au
contraire qu’hypocrisie ou peur</span>. The late Mr. Grote had reason to
lament that when describing such institutions as the far-famed
<span lang="grc">ἱερὸς λόχος</span> of Thebes, the Sacred Band annihilated at Chaeroneia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>he was compelled to a reticence which permitted him to touch
only the surface of the subject. This was inevitable under the
present rule of Cant<a id='r359' href='#f359' class='c016'><sup>[359]</sup></a> in a book intended for the public: but the
same does not apply to my version of The Nights, and now
I proceed to discuss the matter <span lang="fr">sérieusement, honnêtement,
historiquement</span>; to show it in decent nudity not in suggestive
fig-leaf or <span lang="fr">feuille de vigne</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>D.—<span class='sc'>Pederasty.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The “<span lang="la">execrabilis familia pathicorum</span>” first came before me
by a chance of earlier life. In 1845, when Sir Charles Napier
had conquered and annexed Sind, despite a fraction (mostly
venal) which sought favour with the now defunct “Court
of Directors to the Honourable East India Company,” the veteran
began to consider his conquest with a curious eye. It was
reported to him that Karáchi, a townlet of some two thousand
souls and distant not more than a mile from camp, supported no
less than three lupanars or bordels, in which not women but boys
and eunuchs, the former demanding nearly a double price,<a id='r360' href='#f360' class='c016'><sup>[360]</sup></a> lay for
hire. Being then the only British officer who could speak Sindi,
I was asked indirectly to make enquiries and to report upon the
subject; and I undertook the task on express condition that my
report should not be forwarded to the Bombay Government, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>whom supporters of the Conqueror’s policy could expect scant
favour, mercy or justice. Accompanied by a Munshi, Mirza
Mohammed Hosayn of Shiraz, and habited as a merchant, Mirza
Abdullah the Bushiri<a id='r361' href='#f361' class='c016'><sup>[361]</sup></a> passed many an evening in the townlet,
visited all the porneia and obtained the fullest details which were
duly despatched to Government House. But the “Devil’s
Brother” presently quitted Sind leaving in his office my unfortunate
official: this found its way with sundry other reports<a id='r362' href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a> to
Bombay and produced the expected result. A friend in the
Secretariat informed me that my summary dismissal from the
service had been formally proposed by one of Sir Charles Napier’s
successors, whose decease compels me <span lang="la">parcere sepulto</span>. But this
excess of outraged modesty was not allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Subsequent enquiries in many and distant countries enabled me
to arrive at the following conclusions:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1. There exists what I shall call a “Sotadic Zone,” bounded
westwards by the northern shores of the Mediterranean (N. Lat.
43°) and by the southern (N. Lat. 30°). Thus the depth would be
780 to 800 miles including meridional France, the Iberian Peninsula,
Italy and Greece, with the coast-regions of Africa from
Marocco to Egypt.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Running eastward the Sotadic Zone narrows, embracing Asia
Minor, Mesopotamia and Chaldæa, Afghanistan, Sind, the Punjab
and Kashmir.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. In Indo-China the belt begins to broaden, enfolding China,
Japan and Turkistan.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. It then embraces the South Sea Islands and the New World
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>where, at the time of its discovery, Sotadic love was, with some
exceptions, an established racial institution.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Within the Sotadic Zone the Vice is popular and endemic,
held at the worst to be a mere peccadillo, whilst the races to the
North and South of the limits here defined practise it only
sporadically amid the opprobrium of their fellows who, as a rule,
are physically incapable of performing the operation and look
upon it with the liveliest disgust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before entering into topographical details concerning Pederasty,
which I hold to be geographical and climatic, not racial, I must
offer a few considerations of its cause and origin. We must not
forget that the love of boys has its noble sentimental side. The
Platonists and pupils of the Academy, followed by the Sufis or
Moslem Gnostics, held such affection, pure as ardent, to be the
beau idéal which united in man’s soul the creature with the
Creator. Professing to regard youths as the most cleanly and
beautiful objects in this phenomenal world, they declared that by
loving and extolling the <span lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span>, corporeal and intellectual,
of the Demiurgus, disinterestedly and without any admixture of
carnal sensuality, they are paying the most fervent adoration to
the <span lang="la">Causa causans</span>. They add that such affection, passing as it
does the love of women, is far less selfish than fondness for
and admiration of the other sex which, however innocent, always
suggest sexuality<a id='r363' href='#f363' class='c016'><sup>[363]</sup></a>; and Easterns add that the devotion of
the moth to the taper is purer and more fervent than the Bulbul’s
love for the Rose. Amongst the Greeks of the best ages the
system of boy-favourites was advocated on considerations of
morals and politics. The lover undertook the education of the
beloved through precept and example, while the two were conjoined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>by a tie stricter than the fraternal. Hieronymus the
Peripatetic strongly advocated it because the vigorous disposition
of youths and the confidence engendered by their association
often led to the overthrow of tyrannies. Socrates declared that
“a most valiant army might be composed of boys and their
lovers; for that of all men they would be most ashamed to desert
one another.” And even Virgil, despite the foul flavour of
Formosum pastor Corydon, could write:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

<p class='c000'>The only physical cause for the practice which suggests itself to
me and that must be owned to be purely conjectural, is that
within the Sotadic Zone there is a blending of the masculine and
feminine temperaments, a crasis which elsewhere occurs only
sporadically. Hence the male <i><span lang="fr">féminisme</span></i> whereby the man
becomes <span lang="la">patiens</span> as well as <span lang="la">agens</span>, and the woman a tribade, a
votary of <span lang="la">mascula</span> Sappho,<a id='r364' href='#f364' class='c016'><sup>[364]</sup></a> Queen of Frictrices or Rubbers.<a id='r365' href='#f365' class='c016'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Prof.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Mantegazza claims to have discovered the cause of this pathological
love, this perversion of the erotic sense, one of the marvellous
list of amorous vagaries which deserve, not prosecution but the
pitiful care of the physician and the study of the psychologist.
According to him the nerves of the rectum and the genitalia, in all
cases closely connected, are abnormally so in the pathic who obtains,
by intromission, the venereal orgasm which is usually sought
through the sexual organs. So amongst women there are tribads
who can procure no pleasure except by foreign objects introduced
a posteriori. Hence his threefold distribution of sodomy; (1)
Peripheric or anatomical, caused by an unusual distribution of the
nerves and their hyperæsthesia; (2) Luxurious, when love a tergo
is preferred on account of the narrowness of the passage; and
(3) the Psychical. But this is evidently superficial: the question
is what causes this neuropathy, this abnormal distribution and
condition of the nerves.<a id='r366' href='#f366' class='c016'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>As Prince Bismarck finds a moral difference between the male
and female races of history, so I suspect a mixed physical temperament
effected by the manifold subtle influences massed together
in the word climate. Something of the kind is necessary to
explain the fact of this pathological love extending over the
greater portion of the habitable world, without any apparent
connection of race or media, from the polished Greek to the
cannibal Tupi of the Brazil. Walt Whitman speaks of the ashen
grey faces of onanists: the faded colours, the puffy features and the
unwholesome complexion of the professed pederast with his
peculiar cachetic expression, indescribable but once seen never
forgotten, stamp the breed, and Dr. G. Adolph is justified in
declaring “<span lang="de">Alle Gewohnneits-paederasten erkennen sich einander
schnell, oft met einen Blick</span>.” This has nothing in common with
the féminisme which betrays itself in the pathic by womanly gait,
regard and gesture: it is a something sui generis; and the same may
be said of the colour and look of the young priest who honestly
refrains from women and their substitutes. Dr. Tardieu, in his
well-known work, “<span lang="fr">Étude Médico<a id='t210'></a>-légale sur les Attentats aux
Mœurs</span>,” and Dr. Adolph note a peculiar infundibuliform disposition
of the “After” and a smoothness and want of folds even
before any abuse has taken place, together with special forms of
the male organs in confirmed pederasts. But these observations
have been rejected by Caspar, Hoffman, Brouardel and Dr. J. H.
Henry Coutagne (<span lang="fr">Notes sur la Sodomie, Lyon, 1880</span>), and it is a
medical question whose discussion would here be out of place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The origin of pederasty is lost in the night of ages; but its

<p class='c000'>Euripides proposed Laïus father of Oedipus as the inaugurator,
whereas Timæus declared that the fashion of making favourites of
boys was introduced into Greece from Crete, for Malthusian
reasons said Aristotle (Pol. ii. 10) attributing it to Minos.
Herodotus, however, knew far better, having discovered (ii. c. 80)
that the Orphic and Bacchic rites were originally Egyptian. But
the Father of History was a traveller and an annalist rather than
an archæologist and he tripped in the following passage (i. c. 135),
“As soon as they (the Persians) hear of any luxury, they
instantly make it their own, and hence, among other matters,
they have learned from the Hellenes a passion for boys” (“unnatural
lust” says modest Rawlinson). Plutarch (De Malig.
Herod. xiii.)<a id='r370' href='#f370' class='c016'><sup>[370]</sup></a> asserts with much more probability that the
Persians used eunuch boys according to the <i><span lang="la">Mos Græciæ</span></i>, long
before they had seen the Grecian main.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Holy Books of the Hellenes, Homer and Hesiod,
dealing with the heroic ages, there is no trace of pederasty,
although, in a long subsequent generation, Lucian suspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Achilles and Patroclus as he did Orestes and Pylades, Theseus
and Pirithous. Homer’s praises of beauty are reserved for the
feminines, especially his favourite Helen. But the Dorians of
Crete seem to have commended the abuse to Athens and Sparta
and subsequently imported it into Tarentum, Agrigentum and
other colonies. Ephorus in Strabo (x. 4 § 21) gives a curious
account of the violent abduction of beloved boys (<span lang="grc">παρασταθέντες</span>)
by the lover (<span lang="grc">ἐραστής</span>); of the obligations of the ravisher (<span lang="grc">φιλήτωρ</span>)
to the favourite (<span lang="grc">κλεινός</span>)<a id='r371' href='#f371' class='c016'><sup>[371]</sup></a> and of the “marriage-ceremonies” which
lasted two months. See also Plato Laws i. c. 8. Servius (Ad
Æneid. x. 325) informs us “<span lang="la">De Cretensibus accepimus, quod in
amore puerorum intemperantes fuerunt, quod postea in Laconas
et in totam Græciam translatum est</span>.” The Cretans and afterwards
their apt pupils the Chalcidians held it disreputable for a
beautiful boy to lack a lover. Hence Zeus the national Doric
god of Crete loved Ganymede<a id='r372' href='#f372' class='c016'><sup>[372]</sup></a>; Apollo, another Dorian deity,
loved Hyacinth, and Hercules, a Doric hero who grew to be a
sun-god, loved Hylas and a host of others: thus Crete sanctified
the practice by the examples of the gods and demigods. But
when legislation came, the subject had qualified itself for legal
limitation and as such was undertaken by Lycurgus and Solon,
according to Xenophon (Lac. ii. 13), who draws a broad distinction
between the honest love of boys and dishonest (<span lang="grc">αἴχιστος</span>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>lust. They both approved of pure pederastía, like that of
Harmodius and Aristogiton; but forbade it with serviles because
degrading to a free man. Hence the love of boys was spoken
of like that of women (Plato: Phædrus; Repub. <span class='fss'>VI.</span> c. 19 and
Xenophon, Synop. iv. 10) <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, “There was once a boy, or rather
a youth, of exceeding beauty and he had very many lovers”—this
is the language of Hafiz and Sa’adi. Æschylus, Sophocles
and Euripides were allowed to introduce it upon the stage, for
“many men were as fond of having boys for their favourites as
women for their mistresses; and this was a frequent fashion in
many well-regulated cities of Greece.” Poets like Alcæus,
Anacreon, Agathon and Pindar affected it and Theognis sang
of a “beautiful boy in the flower of his youth.” The statesmen
Aristides and Themistocles quarrelled over Stesileus of Teos; and
Pisistratus loved Charmus who first built an altar to Puerile Eros,
while Charmus loved Hippias son of Pisistratus. Demosthenes
the Orator took into keeping a youth called Cnosion greatly to
the indignation of his wife. Xenophon loved Clinias and
Autolycus; Aristotle, Hermeas, Theodectes<a id='r373' href='#f373' class='c016'><sup>[373]</sup></a> and others; Empedocles,
Pausanias; Epicurus, Pytocles; Aristippus, Eutichydes and
Zeno with his Stoics had a philosophic disregard for women,
affecting only pederastía. A man in Athenæus (iv. c. 40) left in
his will that certain youths he had loved should fight like
gladiators at his funeral; and Charicles in Lucian abuses
Callicratidas for his love of “sterile pleasures.” Lastly there
was the notable affair of Alcibiades and Socrates, the “<span lang="la">sanctus
pæderasta</span>”<a id='r374' href='#f374' class='c016'><sup>[374]</sup></a> being <span lang="fr">violemment soupçonné</span> when under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>mantle:—<span lang="la">non semper sine plagâ ab eo surrexit</span>. Athenæus
(v. c. 13) declares that Plato represents Socrates as absolutely
intoxicated with his passion for Alcibiades.<a id='r375' href='#f375' class='c016'><sup>[375]</sup></a> The ancients seem
to have held the connection impure, or Juvenal would not have
written—</p>

<p class='c000'>followed by Firmicus (vii. 14) who speaks of “<span lang="la">Socratici pædicones</span>.”
It is the modern fashion to doubt the pederasty of
the master of Hellenic Sophrosyne, the “Christian before
Christianity;” but such a world-wide term as Socratic love can
hardly be explained by the lucus-a-non-lucendo theory. We are
overapt to apply our nineteenth century prejudices and prepossessions
to the morality of the ancient Greeks who would have
specimen’d such squeamishness in Attic salt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spartans, according to Agnon the Academic (confirmed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Plato, Plutarch and Cicero), treated boys and girls in the same way
before marriage: hence Juvenal (xi. 173) uses “Lacedæmonius”
for a pathic and other writers apply it to a tribade. After the
Peloponnesian War, which ended in B.C. 404, the use became
merged in the abuse. Yet some purity must have survived, even
amongst the Bœotians who produced the famous Narcissus,<a id='r376' href='#f376' class='c016'><sup>[376]</sup></a>
described by Ovid (Met. iii. 339):—</p>

<p class='c000'>for Epaminondas, whose name is mentioned with three beloveds,
established the Holy Regiment composed of mutual lovers,
testifying the majesty of Eros and preferring to a discreditable
life a glorious death. Philip’s reflections on the fatal field of
Chaeroneia form their fittest epitaph. At last the Athenians,
according to Æschines, officially punished Sodomy with death;
but the threat did not abolish bordels of boys, like those of
Karáchi; the Porneia and Pornoboskeia, where slaves and
<span lang="la">pueri venales</span> “stood,” as the term was, near the Pnyx, the city
walls and a certain tower, also about Lycabettus (Æsch. contra
Tim.); and paid a fixed tax to the state. The pleasures of
society in civilised Greece seem to have been sought chiefly in
the heresies of love—Hetairesis<a id='r378' href='#f378' class='c016'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and Sotadism.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>It is calculated that the French of the sixteenth century had
four hundred names for the parts genital and three hundred for

side: Rome, however, borrowed her malpractices, like her religion

utmost sang-froid, “<span lang="la">Ultro te, amator, apage te a dorso meo!</span>”
With increased luxury the evil grew and Livy notices (xxxix. 13),

<p class='c000'>That marvellous Satyricon which unites the wit of Molière<a id='r382' href='#f382' class='c016'><sup>[382]</sup></a> with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the debaucheries of Piron, whilst the writer has been described,
like Rabelais, as <span lang="la">purissimus in impuritate</span>, is a kind of Triumph of
Pederasty. Geiton the hero, a handsome curly-pated hobbledehoy
of seventeen, with his <span lang="fr">câlinerie</span> and wheedling tongue, is courted
like one of the <span lang="la">sequor sexus</span>: his lovers are inordinately jealous
of him and his desertion leaves deep scars upon the heart. But
no dialogue between man and wife <span lang="la">in extremis</span> could be more
pathetic than that in the scene where shipwreck is imminent.
Elsewhere every one seems to attempt his neighbour: a man
<span lang="la">alte succinctus</span> assails Ascyltos; Lycus, the Tarentine skipper,
would force Encolpius and so forth: yet we have the neat and
finished touch (cap. vii.):—“The lamentation was very fine (the
dying man having manumitted his slaves) albeit his wife wept not
as though she loved him. <em>How were it had he not behaved to her
so well?</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>Erotic Latin glossaries<a id='r383' href='#f383' class='c016'><sup>[383]</sup></a> give some ninety words connected with
Pederasty and some, which “speak with Roman simplicity,” are
peculiarly expressive. “Aversa Venus” alludes to women being
treated as boys: hence Martial, translated by Piron, addresses
Mistress Martial (x. 44):—</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la">capillatus</span> or <span lang="la">comatus</span> is also called calamistratus, the darling
curled with crisping-irons; and he is an <span lang="la">Effeminatus <i>i.e.</i> qui
muliebria patitur</span>; or a <span lang="la">Delicatus</span>, slave or eunuch for the use of
the Draucus, Puerarius (boy-lover) or Dominus (Mart. xi. 71). The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Divisor is so called from his practice Hillas <span lang="la">dividere</span> or <span lang="la">cædere</span>,
something like Martial’s <span lang="la">cacare mentulam</span> or Juvenal’s <span lang="la">Hesternæ
occurrere cænæ. Facere vicibus (Juv. vii. 238), incestare se invicem
or mutuum facere (Plaut. Trin. ii. 437)</span>, is described as “a puerile
vice,” in which the two take turns to be active and passive: they
are also called Gemelli and Fratres = <span lang="la">compares in pædicatione.
Illicita libido is = præpostera seu postica Venus</span>, and is expressed
by the picturesque phrase <span lang="la">indicare (seu incurvare) aliquem.
Depilatus, divellere pilos, glaber, lævis and nates pervellere</span> are
allusions to the Sotadic toilette. The fine distinction between
<span lang="la">demittere</span> and <span lang="la">dejicere</span> caput are worthy of a glossary, while
<span lang="la">Pathica puella, puera, putus, pullipremo, pusio, pygiaca sacra,
quadrupes, scarabæus</span> and <span lang="la">smerdalius</span> explain themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Rome the practice extended far and wide to her colonies
especially the Provincia now called Provence. Athenæus (xii. 26)
charges the people of Massilia with “acting like women out of
luxury”; and he cites the saying “May you sail to Massilia!” as
if it were another Corinth. Indeed the whole Keltic race is
charged with <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> by Aristotle (Pol. ii. 66), Strabo, (iv. 199) and
Diodorus Siculus (v. 32). Roman civilisation carried pederasty also
to Northern Africa, where it took firm root, while the negro and
negroid races to the South ignore the erotic perversion, except
where imported by foreigners into such kingdoms as Bornu and
Haussa. In old Mauritania, now Marocco,<a id='r384' href='#f384' class='c016'><sup>[384]</sup></a> the Moors proper are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>notable sodomites; Moslems, even of saintly houses, are permitted
openly to keep catamites, nor do their disciples think worse of
their sanctity for such license: in one case the English wife failed
to banish from the home “that horrid boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet pederasty is forbidden by the Koran. In chapter iv. 20 we
read; “And if two (men) among you commit the crime, then
punish them both,” the penalty being some hurt or damage by
public reproach, insult or scourging. There are four distinct
references to Lot and the Sodomites in chapters vii. 78; xi. 77–84;
xxvi. 160–174 and xxix. 28–35. In the first the prophet commissioned
to the people says, “Proceed ye to a fulsome act wherein
no creature hath foregone ye? Verily ye come to men in lieu of
women lustfully.” We have then an account of the rain which
made an end of the wicked and this judgment on the Cities of the
Plain is repeated with more detail in the second reference. Here
the angels, generally supposed to be three, Gabriel, Michael and
Raphael, appeared to Lot as beautiful youths, a sore temptation
to the sinners and the godly man’s arm was straitened concerning
his visitors because he felt unable to protect them from the erotic
vagaries of his fellow townsmen. He therefore shut his doors and
from behind them argued the matter: presently the riotous
assembly attempted to climb the wall when Gabriel, seeing the
distress of his host, smote them on the face with one of his wings
and blinded them so that all moved off crying for aid and saying
that Lot had magicians in his house. Hereupon the “cities”
which, if they ever existed, must have been Fellah villages, were
uplifted: Gabriel thrust his wing under them and raised them so
high that the inhabitants of the lower heaven (the lunar sphere)
could hear the dogs barking and the cocks crowing. Then came
the rain of stones: these were clay pellets baked in hell-fire,
streaked white and red, or having some mark to distinguish them
from the ordinary and each bearing the name of its destination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>like the missiles which destroyed the host of Abrahat al-Ashram.<a id='r385' href='#f385' class='c016'><sup>[385]</sup></a>
Lastly the “Cities” were turned upside down and cast upon
earth. These circumstantial unfacts are repeated at full length
in the other two chapters; but rather as an instance of Allah’s
power than as a warning against pederasty, which Mohammed
seems to have regarded with philosophic indifference. The
general opinion of his followers is that it should be punished like
fornication unless the offenders made a public act of penitence.
But here, as in adultery, the law is somewhat too clement and will
not convict unless four credible witnesses swear to have seen rem
in re. I have noticed (vol. i. 211) the vicious opinion that the
Ghilmán or Wuldán, the beautiful boys of Paradise, the counterparts
of the Houris, will be lawful catamites to the True Believers in
a future state of happiness: the idea is nowhere countenanced in
Al-Islam; and, although I have often heard debauchees refer to it,
the learned look upon the assertion as scandalous.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in Marocco so the Vice prevails throughout the old regencies
of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli and all the cities of the South
Mediterranean seaboard, whilst it is unknown to the Nubians, the
Berbers and the wilder tribes dwelling inland. Proceeding Eastward
we reach Egypt, that classical region of all abominations
which, marvellous to relate, flourished in closest contact with men
leading the purest of lives, models of moderation and morality, of
religion and virtue. Amongst the ancient Copts <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> was
part and portion of the Ritual and was represented by two male
partridges alternately copulating (Interp. in Priapi Carm. xvii).
The evil would have gained strength by the invasion of Cambyses
(B.C. 524), whose armies, after the victory over Psammenitus,
settled in the Nile-Valley, and held it, despite sundry revolts, for
some hundred and ninety years. During these six generations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the Iranians left their mark upon Lower Egypt and especially, as
the late Rogers Bey proved, upon the Fayyum the most ancient
Delta of the Nile.<a id='r386' href='#f386' class='c016'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Nor would the evil be diminished by the
Hellenes who, under Alexander the Great, “liberator and saviour
of Egypt” (B.C. 332), extinguished the native dynasties: the love
of the Macedonian for Bagoas the Eunuch being a matter of
history. From that time and under the rule of the Ptolemies the
morality gradually decayed; the Canopic orgies extended into
private life and the debauchery of the men was equalled only by
the depravity of the women. Neither Christianity nor Al-Islam
could effect a change for the better; and social morality seems to
have been at its worst during the past century when Sonnini
travelled (A.D. 1717). The French officer, who is thoroughly
trustworthy, draws the darkest picture of the widely-spread criminality,
especially of the bestiality and the sodomy (chapt. xv.)
which formed the “delight of the Egyptians.” During the
Napoleonic conquest Jaubert in his letter to General Bruix
(p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) says, “<span lang="fr">Les Arabes et les Mamelouks ont traité
quelques-uns de nos prisonniers comme Socrate traitait, dit-on,
Alcibiade. Il fallait périr ou y passer</span>.” Old Anglo-Egyptians
still chuckle over the tale of Sa’id Pasha and M. de Ruyssenaer,
the high-dried and highly respectable Consul-General for the
Netherlands, who was solemnly advised to make the experiment,
active and passive, before offering his opinion upon the subject.
In the present age extensive intercourse with Europeans has
produced not a reformation but a certain reticence amongst the
upper classes: they are as vicious as ever, but they do not care
for displaying their vices to the eyes of mocking strangers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Syria and Palestine, another ancient focus of abominations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>borrowed from Egypt and exaggerated the worship of Androgynic
and hermaphroditic deities. Plutarch (De Iside) notes that
the old Nilotes held the moon to be of “male-female sex,” the
men sacrificing to Luna and the women to Lunus.<a id='r387' href='#f387' class='c016'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Isis also
was a hermaphrodite, the idea being that Æther or Air (the
lower heavens) was the menstruum of generative nature; and
Damascius explained the tenet by the all-fruitful and prolific
powers of the atmosphere. Hence the fragment attributed to
Orpheus, the song of Jupiter (Air)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>All things from Jove descend</div>
      <div class='line'>Jove was a male, Jove was a deathless bride;</div>
      <div class='line'>For men call Air, of two-fold sex, the Jove.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Julius Firmicus relates that “The Assyrians and part of the
Africans” (along the Mediterranean seaboard?) “hold Air to be
the chief element and adore its fanciful figure (<span lang="la">imaginata figura</span>),
consecrated under the name of Juno or the Virgin Venus. *&#8196;*&#8196;*
Their companies of priests cannot duly serve her unless they
effeminate their faces, smooth their skins and disgrace their
masculine sex by feminine ornaments. You may see men in
their very temples amid general groans enduring miserable dalliance
and becoming passives like women (<span lang="la">viros muliebria pati</span>) and
they expose, with boasting and ostentation, the pollution of the
impure and immodest body.” Here we find the religious significance
of eunuchry. It was practised as a religious rite by the
Tympanotribas or Gallus,<a id='r388' href='#f388' class='c016'><sup>[388]</sup></a> the castrated votary of Rhea or Bona
Mater, in Phrygia called Cybele, self-mutilated but <em>not</em> in memory
of Atys; and by a host of other creeds: even Christianity, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>sundry texts show,<a id='r389' href='#f389' class='c016'><sup>[389]</sup></a> could not altogether cast out the old possession.
Here too we have an explanation of Sotadic love in its second
stage, when it became, like cannibalism, a matter of superstition.
Assuming a nature-implanted tendency, we see that like human
sacrifice it was held to be the most acceptable offering to the God-goddess
in the Orgia or sacred ceremonies, a something set apart
for peculiar worship. Hence in Rome as in Egypt the temples of
Isis (<span lang="la">Inachidos limina, Isiacæ sacraria Lunæ</span>) were centres of
sodomy and the religious practice was adopted by the grand
priestly castes from Mesopotamia to Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p class='c000'>We find the earliest written notices of the Vice in the mythical
destruction of the Pentapolis (Gen. xix.), Sodom, Gomorrah
(= ’Ámirah, the cultivated country), Adama, Zeboïm and Zoar
or Bela. The legend has been amply embroidered by the Rabbis
who make the Sodomites do everything <i><span lang="fr">à l’envers</span></i>: <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> if a man
were wounded he was fined for bloodshed and was compelled to
fee the offender; and if one cut off the ear of a neighbour’s ass
he was condemned to keep the animal till the ear grew again.
The Jewish doctors declare the people to have been a race of
sharpers with rogues for magistrates, and thus they justify the
judgment which they read literally. But the traveller cannot
accept it. I have carefully examined the lands at the North and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>at the South of that most beautiful lake, the so-called Dead Sea,
whose tranquil loveliness, backed by the grand plateau of Moab,
is an object of admiration to all save patients suffering from the
strange disease “Holy Land on the Brain.”<a id='r390' href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a> But I found no
traces of craters in the neighbourhood, no signs of vulcanism, no
remains of “meteoric stones”: the asphalt which named the
water is a mineralised vegetable washed out of the limestones,
and the sulphur and salt are brought down by the Jordan into a
lake without issue. I must therefore look upon the history as a
myth which may have served a double purpose. The first would
be to deter the Jew from the Malthusian practices of his pagan
predecessors, upon whom obloquy was thus cast, so far resembling
the scandalous and absurd legend which explained the names of
the children of Lot by Pheiné and Thamma as “Moab” (Mu-ab)
the water or semen of the father, and “Ammon” as mother’s son,
that is, bastard. The fable would also account for the abnormal
fissure containing the lower Jordan and the Dead Sea, which the
late Sir R. I. Murchison used wrong-headedly to call a “Volcano
of Depression”: this geological feature, that cuts off the river-basin
from its natural outlet the Gulf of Eloth (Akabah), must
date from myriads of years before there were “Cities of the Plains.”
But the main object of the ancient lawgiver, Osarsiph, Moses
or the Moseidæ, was doubtless to discountenance a perversion
prejudicial to the increase of population. And he speaks with
no uncertain voice, Whoso lieth with a beast shall surely be put
to death (Exod. xxii. 19): If a man lie with mankind as he lieth
with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination:
they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them
(Levit. xx. 13; where v.v. 15–16 threaten with death man and
woman who lie with beasts). Again, There shall be no whore
of the daughters of Israel nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel
(Deut. xxii. 5).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The old commentators on the Sodom-myth are most unsatisfactory
<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Parkhurst, <i><span lang="la">s.v.</span></i> Kadesh. “From hence we may observe
the peculiar propriety of this punishment of Sodom and of the
neighbouring cities. By their sodomitical impurities they meant
to acknowledge the Heavens as the cause of fruitfulness independently
upon, and in opposition to Jehovah<a id='r391' href='#f391' class='c016'><sup>[391]</sup></a>; therefore
Jehovah, by raining upon them not genial showers but brimstone
from heaven, not only destroyed the inhabitants, but also changed
all that country, which was before as the garden of God, into
brimstone and salt that is not sown nor beareth, neither any grass
groweth therein.” It must be owned that to this Pentapolis was
dealt very hard measure for religiously and diligently practising
a popular rite which a host of cities even in the present day, as
Naples and Shiraz, to mention no others, affect for simple luxury
and affect with impunity. The myth may probably reduce itself
to very small proportions, a few Fellah villages destroyed by a
storm, like that which drove Brennus from Delphi.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hebrews entering Syria found it religionised by Assyria
and Babylonia, whence Accadian Ishtar had passed west and had
become Ashtoreth, Ashtaroth or Ashirah,<a id='r392' href='#f392' class='c016'><sup>[392]</sup></a> the Anaitis of Armenia,
the Phœnician Astarte and the Greek Aphrodite, the great Moon-goddess,<a id='r393' href='#f393' class='c016'><sup>[393]</sup></a>
who is queen of Heaven and Love. In another phase
she was Venus Mylitta = the Procreatrix, in Chaldaic Mauludatá
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and in Arabic Moawallidah, she who bringeth forth. She was
worshipped by men habited as women and vice versâ; for which
reason in the Torah (Deut. xx. 5) the sexes are forbidden to
change dress. The male prostitutes were called Kadesh the holy,
the women being Kadeshah, and doubtless gave themselves up to
great excesses. Eusebius (De bit. Const. iii. c. 55) describes a school
of impurity at Aphac, where women and “men who were not
men” practised all manner of abominations in honour of the
Demon (Venus). Here the Phrygian symbolism of Kybele and
Attis (Atys) had become the Syrian Ba’al Tammuz and Astarte,
and the Grecian Dionæa and Adonis, the anthropomorphic forms
of the two greater lights. The site, Apheca, now Wady al-Afik
on the route from Bayrut to the Cedars, is a glen of wild and
wondrous beauty, fitting frame-work for the loves of goddess and
demigod: and the ruins of the temple destroyed by Constantine
contrast with Nature’s work, the glorious fountain, <span lang="la">splendidior
vitro</span>, which feeds the River Ibrahim and still at times Adonis
runs purple to the sea.<a id='r394' href='#f394' class='c016'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Phœnicians spread this androgynic worship over Greece.
We find the consecrated servants and votaries of Corinthian
Aphrodite called Hierodouli (Strabo viii. 6), who aided the ten
thousand courtesans in gracing the Venus-temple: from this
excessive luxury arose the proverb popularised by Horace. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>of the head-quarters of the cult was Cyprus where, as Servius
relates (Ad Æn. ii. 632), stood the <span lang="fr">simulacre</span> of a bearded
Aphrodite with feminine body and costume, sceptered and mitred
like a man. The sexes when worshipping it exchanged habits
and here the virginity was offered in sacrifice: Herodotus (i. c. 199)
describes this defloration at Babylon but sees only the shameful
part of the custom which was a mere consecration of a tribal rite.
Everywhere girls before marriage belong either to the father or to
the clan and thus the maiden paid the debt due to the public before
becoming private property as a wife. The same usage prevailed
in ancient Armenia and in parts of Ethiopia; and Herodotus tells
us that a practice very much like the Babylonian “is found also
in certain parts of the Island of Cyprus:” it is noticed by Justin
(xviii. c. 5) and probably it explains the “Succoth Benoth” or
Damsels’ booths which the Babylonians transplanted to the cities
of Samaria.<a id='r395' href='#f395' class='c016'><sup>[395]</sup></a> The Jews seem very successfully to have copied the
abominations of their pagan neighbours, even in the matter of the
“dog.”<a id='r396' href='#f396' class='c016'><sup>[396]</sup></a> In the reign of wicked Rehoboam (B.C. 975) “There
were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the
abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the
children of Israel” (1 Kings xiv. 20). The scandal was abated by
zealous King Asa (B.C. 958) whose grandmother<a id='r397' href='#f397' class='c016'><sup>[397]</sup></a> was high-priestess
of Priapus (<span lang="la">princeps in sacris Priapi</span>): he “took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>away the sodomites out of the land” (1 Kings xv. 12). Yet the
prophets were loud in their complaints, especially the so-called
Isaiah (B.C. 760), “except the Lord of Hosts had left to us a
very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom” (i. 9); and
strong measures were required from good King Josiah (B.C. 641)
who amongst other things, “brake down the houses of the sodomites
that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove
hangings for the grove” (2 Kings xxiii. 7). The bordels of boys
(<span lang="la">pueris alienis adhæseverunt</span>) appear to have been near the
Temple.</p>

<p class='c000'>Syria has not forgotten her old “praxis.” At Damascus I
found some noteworthy cases amongst the religious of the great
Amawi Mosque. As for the Druses we have Burckhardt’s authority
(Travels in Syria, etc., p. 202) “unnatural propensities are very
common amongst them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sotadic Zone covers the whole of Asia Minor and
Mesopotamia now occupied by the “unspeakable Turk,” a race
of born pederasts; and in the former region we first notice a
peculiarity of the feminine figure, the <span lang="la">mammæ inclinatæ,
jacentes et pannosæ</span>, which prevails over all this part of the belt.
Whilst the women to the North and South have, with local exceptions,
the <span lang="la">mammæ stantes</span> of the European virgin,<a id='r398' href='#f398' class='c016'><sup>[398]</sup></a> those of
Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and Kashmir lose all the fine curves
of the bosom, sometimes even before the first child; and after it
the hemispheres take the form of bags. This cannot result from
climate only; the women of Marathá-land, inhabiting a damper
and hotter region than Kashmir, are noted for fine firm breasts
even after parturition. <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> of course prevails more in the cities
and towns of Asiatic Turkey than in the villages; yet even these
are infected; while the nomad Turcomans contrast badly in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>point with the Gypsies, those Badawin of India. The Kurd
population is of Iranian origin, which means that the evil is
deeply rooted: I have noted in The Nights that the great and
glorious Saladin was a habitual pederast. The Armenians, as
their national character is, will prostitute themselves for gain
but prefer women to boys: Georgia supplied Turkey with
catamites whilst Circassia sent concubines. In Mesopotamia the
barbarous invader has almost obliterated the ancient civilisation
which is ante-dated only by the Nilotic: the mysteries of old
Babylon nowhere survive save in certain obscure tribes like the
Mandæans, the Devil-worshippers and the Alí-iláhi. Entering
Persia we find the reverse of Armenia; and, despite Herodotus,
I believe that Iran borrowed her pathologic love from the peoples
of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley and not from the then insignificant
Greeks. But whatever may be its origin, the corruption is now
bred in the bone. It begins in boyhood and many Persians
account for it by paternal severity. Youths arrived at puberty
find none of the facilities with which Europe supplies fornication.
Onanism<a id='r399' href='#f399' class='c016'><sup>[399]</sup></a> is to a certain extent discouraged by circumcision, and
meddling with the father’s slave-girls and concubines would be
risking cruel punishment if not death. Hence they use each other
by turns, a “puerile practice” known as Alish-Takish, the Lat.
facere vicibus or mutuum facere. Temperament, media, and
atavism recommend the custom to the general; and after marrying
and begetting heirs, Paterfamilias returns to the Ganymede.
Hence all the odes of Hafiz are addressed to youths, as proved by
such Arabic exclamations as ’Afáka ’llah = Allah assain thee
(masculine)<a id='r400' href='#f400' class='c016'><sup>[400]</sup></a>: the object is often fanciful but it would be held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>coarse and immodest to address an imaginary girl.<a id='r401' href='#f401' class='c016'><sup>[401]</sup></a> An illustration
of the penchant is told at Shiraz concerning a certain
Mujtahid, the head of the Shi’ah creed, corresponding with a
prince-archbishop in Europe. A friend once said to him, “There
is a question I would fain address to your Eminence but I lack
the daring to do so.” “Ask and fear not,” replied the Divine. “It
is this, O Mujtahid! Figure thee in a garden of roses and
hyacinths with the evening breeze waving the cypress-heads, a
fair youth of twenty sitting by thy side and the assurance of
perfect privacy. What, prithee, would be the result?” The holy
man bowed the chin of doubt upon the collar of meditation; and,
too honest to lie, presently whispered, “Allah defend me from
such temptation of Satan!” Yet even in Persia men have not
been wanting who have done their utmost to uproot the Vice: in
the same Shiraz they speak of a father who, finding his son in
flagrant delict, put him to death like Brutus or Lynch of Galway.
Such isolated cases, however, can effect nothing. Chardin tells
us that houses of male prostitution were common in Persia whilst
those of women were unknown: the same is the case in the
present day and the boys are prepared with extreme care by diet,
baths, depilation, unguents and a host of artists in cosmetics.<a id='r402' href='#f402' class='c016'><sup>[402]</sup></a>
<span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> is looked upon at most as a peccadillo and its mention
crops up in every jest-book. When the Isfahan man mocked
Shaykh Sa’adi by comparing the bald pates of Shirazian elders to
the bottom of a lotá, a brass cup with a wide-necked opening used
in the Hammam, the witty poet turned its aperture upwards and
thereto likened the well-abused <span lang="la">podex</span> of an Isfahani youth.
Another favourite piece of Shirazian “chaff” is to declare that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>when an Isfahan father would set up his son in business he provides
him with a pound of rice, meaning that he can sell the result
as compost for the kitchen-garden, and with the price buy another
meal: hence the saying Khakh-i-pái káhú = the soil at the lettuce-root.
The Isfahanis retort with the name of a station or halting-place
between the two cities where, under pretence of making
travellers stow away their riding-gear, many a Shirázi had been
raped: hence “Zín o takaltú tú bi-bar” = carry within saddle
and saddle-cloth! A favourite Persian punishment for strangers
caught in the Harem or Gynæceum is to strip and throw them
and expose them to the embraces of the grooms and negro-slaves.
I once asked a Shirazi how penetration was possible if the patient
resisted with all the force of the sphincter muscle: he smiled and
said, “Ah, we Persians know a trick to get over that; we apply a
sharpened tent-peg to the crupper-bone (os coccygis) and knock
till he opens.” A well-known missionary to the East during the
last generation was subjected to this gross insult by one of the
Persian Prince-governors, whom he had infuriated by his conversion-mania:
in his memoirs he alludes to it by mentioning his
“dishonoured person;” but English readers cannot comprehend
the full significance of the confession. About the same time
Shaykh Nasr, Governor of Bushire, a man famed for facetious
blackguardism, used to invite European youngsters serving in the
Bombay Marine and ply them with liquor till they were insensible.
Next morning the middies mostly complained that the champagne
had caused a curious irritation and soreness in la parte-poste. The
same Eastern “Scrogin” would ask his guests if they had ever
seen a man-cannon (Ádami-top); and, on their replying in the
negative, a grey-beard slave was dragged in blaspheming and
struggling with all his strength. He was presently placed on all
fours and firmly held by the extremities; his bag-trousers were
let down and a dozen peppercorns were inserted <span lang="la">ano suo</span>: the
target was a sheet of paper held at a reasonable distance; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>match was applied by a pinch of cayenne in the nostrils; the
sneeze started the grapeshot and the number of hits on the butt
decided the bets. We can hardly wonder at the loose conduct of
Persian women perpetually mortified by marital pederasty. During
the unhappy campaign of 1856–57 in which, with the exception of
a few brilliant skirmishes, we gained no glory, Sir James Outram
and the Bombay army showing how badly they could work, there
was a formal outburst of the Harems; and even women of
princely birth could not be kept out of the officers’ quarters.</p>

long tresses and henna’d fingers and toes, riding luxuriously in
Kajáwas or camel-panniers: they are called Kúch-i safari, or
travelling wives, and the husbands trudge patiently by their
sides. In Afghanistan also a frantic debauchery broke out
amongst the women when they found incubi who were not
pederasts; and the scandal was not the most insignificant cause
of the general rising at Cabul (Nov. 1841), and the slaughter of
Macnaghten, Burnes and other British officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. Louis Daville describes the infamies of Lahore and
Lakhnau where he found men dressed as women, with flowing
locks under crowns of flowers, imitating the feminine walk and
gestures, voice and fashion of speech, and ogling their admirers
with all the coquetry of bayadères. Victor Jacquemont’s Journal
de Voyage describes the pederasty of Ranjít Singh, the “Lion
of the Panjáb,” and his pathic Guláb Singh whom the English
inflicted upon Cashmir as ruler by way of paying for his treason.
Yet the Hindus, I repeat, hold pederasty in abhorrence and are
as much scandalised by being called Gánd-márá (anus-beater) or
Gándú (anuser) as Englishmen would be. During the years
1843–44 my regiment, almost all Hindu Sepoys of the Bombay
Presidency, was stationed at a purgatory called Bandar Ghárrá,<a id='r405' href='#f405' class='c016'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
a sandy flat with a scatter of verdigris-green milk-bush some forty
miles north of Karáchi the head-quarters. The dirty heap of
mud-and-mat hovels, which represented the adjacent native
village, could not supply a single woman; yet only one case of
pederasty came to light and that after a tragical fashion some
years afterwards. A young Brahman had connection with a
soldier comrade of low caste and this had continued till, in an
unhappy hour, the Pariah patient ventured to become the agent.
The latter, in Arab. Al-Fá’il = the “doer,” is not an object of
contempt like Al-Mafúl = the “done”; and the high-caste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>sepoy, stung by remorse and revenge, loaded his musket and
deliberately shot his paramour. He was hanged by court
martial at Hyderabad and, when his last wishes were asked
he begged in vain to be suspended by the feet; the idea being
that his soul, polluted by exiting “below the waist,” would be
doomed to endless transmigrations through the lowest forms
of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond India, I have stated, the Sotadic Zone begins to
broaden out embracing all China, Turkistan and Japan. The
Chinese, as far as we know them in the great cities, are omnivorous
and omnifutuentes: they are the chosen people of
debauchery and their systematic bestiality with ducks, goats,
and other animals is equalled only by their pederasty. Kæmpfer
and Orlof Torée (Voyage en Chine) notice the public houses for
boys and youths in China and Japan. Mirabeau (L’Anandryne)
describes the tribadism of their women in hammocks. When
Pekin was plundered the Harems contained a number of balls
a little larger than the old musket-bullet, made of thin silver
with a loose pellet of brass inside somewhat like a <span lang="fr">grelot</span><a id='r406' href='#f406' class='c016'><sup>[406]</sup></a>: these
articles were placed by the women between the labia and an
up-and-down movement on the bed gave a pleasant titillation
when nothing better was to be procured. They have every
artifice of luxury, aphrodisiacs, erotic perfumes and singular
applications. Such are the pills which, dissolved in water and
applied to the glans penis, cause it to throb and swell: so
according to Amerigo Vespucci American women could artificially
increase the size of their husbands’ parts.<a id='r407' href='#f407' class='c016'><sup>[407]</sup></a> The Chinese
bracelet of caoutchouc studded with points now takes the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>of the Herisson, or <span lang="la">Annulus hirsutus</span>,<a id='r408' href='#f408' class='c016'><sup>[408]</sup></a> which was bound between
the glans and prepuce. Of the penis succedaneus, that imitation
of the <span lang="la">Arbor vitæ</span> or Soter Kosmou, which the Latins called
<span lang="la">phallus</span> and <span lang="la">fascinum</span>,<a id='r409' href='#f409' class='c016'><sup>[409]</sup></a> the French <span lang="fr">godemiché</span> and the Italians
<span lang="it">passatempo</span> and <span lang="it">diletto</span> (whence our “dildo”), every kind abounds,
varying from a stuffed “French letter” to a cone of ribbed horn
which looks like an instrument of torture. For the use of men
they have the “merkin,”<a id='r410' href='#f410' class='c016'><sup>[410]</sup></a> a heart-shaped article of thin skin
stuffed with cotton and slit with an artificial vagina: two tapes
at the top and one below lash it to the back of a chair. The
erotic literature of the Chinese and Japanese is highly developed
and their illustrations are often facetious as well as obscene. All
are familiar with that of the strong man who by a blow with his
enormous phallus shivers a copper pot; and the ludicrous contrast
of the huge-membered wights who land in the Isle of Women
and presently escape from it, wrinkled and shrivelled, true
Domine Dolittles. Of Turkistan we know little, but what we
know confirms my statement. Mr. Schuyler in his Turkistan
(i. 132) offers an illustration of a “Batchah” (Pers. bachcheh =
catamite), “or singing-boy surrounded by his admirers.” Of
the Tartars Master Purchas laconically says (v. 419), “They
are addicted to Sodomie or Buggerie.” The learned casuist
Dr. Thomas Sanchez the Spaniard had (says Mirabeau in Kadhésch)
to decide a difficult question concerning the sinfulness
of a peculiar erotic perversion. The Jesuits brought home from
Manilla a tailed man whose moveable prolongation of the os
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>coccygis measured from 7 to 10 inches: he had placed himself
between two women, enjoying one naturally while the other used
his tail as a penis succedaneus. The verdict was incomplete
sodomy and simple fornication. For the islands north of Japan,
the “Sodomitical Sea,” and the “<span lang="enm">nayle of tynne</span>” thrust through
the prepuce to prevent sodomy, see Lib. ii. chap. 4 of Master
Thomas Caudish’s Circumnavigation, and vol. vi. of Pinkerton’s
Geography translated by Walckenaer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing over to America we find that the Sotadic Zone contains
the whole hemisphere from Behring’s Straits to Magellan’s. This
prevalence of “<span lang="la">mollities</span>” astonishes the anthropologist, who is
apt to consider pederasty the growth of luxury and the especial
product of great and civilised cities, unnecessary and therefore
unknown to simple savagery where the births of both sexes are
about equal and female infanticide is not practised. In many parts
of the New World this perversion was accompanied by another
depravity of taste—confirmed cannibalism.<a id='r411' href='#f411' class='c016'><sup>[411]</sup></a> The forests and
campos abounded in game from the deer to the pheasant-like
penelope, and the seas and rivers produced an unfailing supply
of excellent fish and shell-fish<a id='r412' href='#f412' class='c016'><sup>[412]</sup></a>; yet the Brazilian Tupis preferred
the meat of man to every other food.</p>

<p class='c000'>A glance at Mr. Bancroft<a id='r413' href='#f413' class='c016'><sup>[413]</sup></a> proves the abnormal development
of sodomy amongst the savages and barbarians of the New World.
Even his half-frozen Hyperboreans “possess all the passions
which are supposed to develop most freely under a milder
temperature” (i. 58). “The voluptuousness and polygamy of the
North American Indians, under a temperature of almost perpetual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>winter is far greater than that of the most sensual tropical nations”
(Martin’s Brit. Colonies iii. 524). I can quote only a few of the
most remarkable instances. Of the Koniagas of Kadiak Island
and the Thinkleets we read (i. 81–82), “The most repugnant of all
their practices is that of male concubinage. A Kadiak mother
will select her handsomest and most promising boy, and dress
and rear him as a girl, teaching him only domestic duties, keeping
him at women’s work, associating him with women and girls, in
order to render his effeminacy complete. Arriving at the age of ten
or fifteen years, he is married to some wealthy man who regards
such a companion as a great acquisition. These male concubines
are called Achnutschik or Schopans” (the authorities quoted being
Holmberg, Langsdorff, Billing, Choris, Lisiansky and Marchand).
The same is the case in Nutka Sound and the Aleutian Islands,
where “male concubinage obtains throughout, but not to the same
extent as amongst the Koniagas.” The objects of “unnatural”
affection have their beards carefully plucked out as soon as the
face-hair begins to grow, and their chins are tattooed like those
of the women. In California the first missionaries found the same
practice, the youths being called Joya (Bancroft, i. 415 and authorities
Palon, Crespi, Boscana, Mofras, Torquemada, Duflot and Fages).
The Comanches unite incest with sodomy (i. 515). “In New Mexico
according to Arlegui, Ribas, and other authors, male concubinage
prevails to a great extent, these loathsome semblances of
humanity, whom to call beastly were a slander upon beasts,
dress themselves in the clothes and perform the functions of
women, the use of weapons being denied them” (i. 585). Pederasty
was systematically practised by the peoples of Cueba, Careta, and
other parts of Central America. The Caciques and some of the
headmen kept harems of youths who, as soon as destined for the
unclean office, were dressed as women. They went by the name
of Camayoas, and were hated and detested by the goodwives
(i. 773–74). Of the Nahua nations Father Pierre de Gand (alias
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>de Musa) writes, “<span lang="fr">Un certain nombre de prêtres n’avaient point
de femmes</span>, <i><span lang="la">sed eorum loco pueros quibus abutebantur</span></i>. <span lang="fr">Ce péché
était si commun dans ce pays que, jeunes ou vieux, tous étaient
infectés; ils y étaient si adonnés que mêmes les enfants de six ans
s’y livraient</span>” (Ternaux-Campans, Voyages, Série i. Tom. x. p. 197).
Among the Mayas of Yucatan Las Casas declares that the great
prevalence of “unnatural” lust made parents anxious to see their
progeny wedded as soon as possible (Kingsborough’s Mex. Ant.
viii. 135). In Vera Paz a god, called by some Chin and by others
Cavial and Maran, taught it by committing the act with another
god. Some fathers gave their sons a boy to use as a woman, and
if any other approached this pathic he was treated as an adulterer.
In Yucatan images were found by Bernal Diaz proving the
sodomitical propensities of the people (Bancroft v. 198). De
Pauw (<span lang="fr">Recherches Philosophiques sur les Américains</span>, London,
1771) has much to say about the subject in Mexico generally: in
the northern provinces men married youths who, dressed like women,
were forbidden to carry arms. According to Gomara there were
at Tamalipas houses of male prostitution; and from Diaz and
others we gather that the <i><span lang="es">pecado nefando</span></i> was the rule. Both in
Mexico and in Peru it might have caused, if it did not justify, the
cruelties of the Conquistadores. Pederasty was also general
throughout Nicaragua, and the early explorers found it amongst
the indigenes of Panama.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have authentic details concerning <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> in Peru and its
adjacent lands, beginning with Cieza de Leon, who must be read
in the original or in the translated extracts of Purchas (vol. v.
942, etc.), not in the cruelly castrated form preferred by the
Council of the Hakluyt Society. Speaking of the New Granada
Indians he tells us that “at Old Port (Porto Viejo) and Puna, the
Deuill so farre prevayled in their beastly Deuotions that there
were Boyes consecrated to serue in the Temple; and at the times of
their Sacrifices and Solemne Feasts, the Lords and principal men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>abused them to that detestable filthinesse;” <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> performed their
peculiar worship. Generally in the hill-countries the Devil,
under the show of holiness, had introduced the practice; for every
temple or chief house of adoration kept one or two men or
more which were attired like women, even from the time of their
childhood, and spake like them, imitating them in everything;
with these, under pretext of holiness and religion, their principal
men on principal days had commerce. Speaking of the arrival of
the Giants<a id='r414' href='#f414' class='c016'><sup>[414]</sup></a> at Point Santa Elena, Cieza says (chap. lii.), they were
detested by the natives, because in using their women they killed
them, and their men also in another way. All the natives declare
that God brought upon them a punishment proportioned to the
enormity of their offence. When they were engaged together in
their accursed intercourse, a fearful and terrible fire came down
from Heaven with a great noise, out of the midst of which there
issued a shining Angel with a glittering sword, wherewith at one
blow they were all killed and the fire consumed them.<a id='r415' href='#f415' class='c016'><sup>[415]</sup></a> There
remained a few bones and skulls which God allowed to bide unconsumed
by the fire, as a memorial of this punishment. In the
Hakluyt Society’s bowdlerisation we read of the Tumbez Islanders
being “very vicious, many of them committing the abominable
offence” (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>); also, “If by the advice of the Devil any Indian
commit the abominable crime, it is thought little of and they call
him a woman.” In chapters lii. and lviii. we find exceptions.
The Indians of Huancabamba, “although so near the peoples of
Puerto Viejo and Guayaquil, do not commit the abominable sin;”
and the Serranos, or island mountaineers, as sorcerers and
magicians inferior to the coast peoples, were not so much addicted
to sodomy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The Royal Commentaries of the Yncas show that the evil was
of a comparatively modern growth. In the early period of
Peruvian history the people considered the crime “unspeakable:”
if a Cuzco Indian, not of Yncarial blood, angrily addressed the
term pederast to another, he was held infamous for many days.
One of the generals having reported to the Ynca Ccapacc
Yupanqui that there were some sodomites, not in all the valleys,
but one here and one there, “nor was it a habit of all the inhabitants
but only of certain persons who practised it privately,”
the ruler ordered that the criminals should be publicly burnt alive
and their houses, crops and trees destroyed: moreover, to show
his abomination, he commanded that the whole village should so
be treated if one man fell into this habit (Lib. iii. cap. 13). Elsewhere
we learn, “There were sodomites in some provinces, though
not openly nor universally, but some particular men and in secret.
In some parts they had them in their temples, because the Devil
persuaded them that the Gods took great delight in such people,
and thus the Devil acted as a traitor to remove the veil of shame
that the Gentiles felt for this crime and to accustom them to
commit it in public and in common.”</p>

<p class='c000'>During the times of the Conquistadores male concubinage had
become the rule throughout Peru. At Cuzco, we are told by
Nuno de Guzman in 1530, “The last which was taken, and which
fought most couragiously, was a man in the habite of a
woman, which confessed that from a childe he had gotten his liuing
by that filthinesse, for which I caused him to be burned.” V. F.
Lopez<a id='r416' href='#f416' class='c016'><sup>[416]</sup></a> draws a frightful picture of pathologic love in Peru.
Under the reigns which followed that of Inti-Kapak (Ccapacc)
Amauri, the country was attacked by invaders of a giant race
coming from the sea: they practised pederasty after a fashion so
shameless that the conquered tribes were compelled to fly (p. <a href='#Page_271'>271</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Under the pre-Yncarial Amauta, or priestly dynasty, Peru had lapsed
into savagery and the kings of Cuzco preserved only the name.
“<span lang="fr">Toutes ces hontes et toutes ces misères provenaient de deux vices
infâmes, la bestialité et la sodomie. Les femmes surtout étaient
offensées de voir la nature frustrée de tous ses droits. Elles
pleuraient ensemble en leurs réunions sur le misérable état dans
lequel elles étaient tombées, sur le mépris avec lequel elles étaient
traitées. * * * * Le monde était renversé, les hommes
s’aimaient et étaient jaloux les uns des autres. * * * Elles
cherchaient, mais en vain, les moyens de remédier au mal; elles
employaient des herbes et des recettes diaboliques qui leur
ramenaient bien quelques individus, mais ne pouvaient arrêter les
progrès incessants du vice. Cet état de choses constitua un
véritable moyen âge, qui dura jusqu’à l’établissement du
gouvernement des Incas</span>” (p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>When Sinchi Roko (the xcvth of Montesinos and the xcist
of Garcilazo) became Ynca, he found morals at the lowest
ebb. “<span lang="fr">Ni la prudence de l’Inca, ni les lois sévères qu’il
avait promulguées n’avaient pu extirper entièrement le péché
contre nature. Il reprit avec une nouvelle violence, et les femmes
en furent si jalouses qu’un grand nombre d’elles tuèrent leurs
maris. Les devins et les sorciers passaient leurs journées à
fabriquer, avec certaines herbes, des compositions magiques qui
rendaient fous ceux qui en mangeaient<a id='t245'></a>, et les femmes en faisaient
prendre, soit dans les aliments, soit dans la chicha, à ceux dont
elles étaient jalouses</span>” (p. <a href='#Page_291'>291</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>I have remarked that the Tupi races of the Brazil were infamous
for cannibalism and sodomy; nor could the latter be only racial
as proved by the fact that colonists of pure Lusitanian blood
followed in the path of the savages. Sr. Antonio Augusto da
Costa Aguiar<a id='r417' href='#f417' class='c016'><sup>[417]</sup></a> is outspoken upon this point. “A crime which in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>England leads to the gallows, and which is the very measure of
abject depravity, passes with impunity amongst us by the participating
in it of almost all or of many (<i><span lang="pt">de quasi todos, ou de muitos</span></i>).
Ah! if the wrath of Heaven were to fall by way of punishing such
crimes (<i><span lang="la">delictos</span></i>), more than one city of this Empire, more than a
dozen, would pass into the category of the Sodoms and Gomorrahs”
(p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>). Till late years pederasty in the Brazil was looked upon
as a peccadillo; the European immigrants following the practice
of the wild men who were naked but not, as Columbus said,
“clothed in innocence.” One of Her Majesty’s Consuls used to
tell a tale of the hilarity provoked in a “fashionable” assembly by
the open declaration of a young gentleman that his mulatto-“patient”
had suddenly turned upon him, insisting upon becoming
agent. Now, however, under the influences of improved education
and respect for the public opinion of Europe, pathologic love
amongst the Luso-Brazilians has been reduced to the normal
limits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside the Sotadic Zone, I have said, <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span> is sporadic, not
endemic: yet the physical and moral effect of great cities where
puberty, they say, is induced earlier than in country sites, has been
the same in most lands, causing modesty to decay and pederasty
to flourish. The Badawi Arab is wholly pure of <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span>; yet
San’á the capital of Al-Yaman and other centres of population
have long been and still are thoroughly infected. History tells us
of Zú Shanátir, tyrant of “Arabia Felix,” in A.D. 478, who used
to entice young men into his palace and cause them after use to
be cast out of the windows: this unkindly ruler was at last
poinarded by the youth Zerash, known from his long ringlets as
“Zú Nowás.” The negro race is mostly untainted by sodomy and
tribadism. Yet Joan dos Sanctos<a id='r418' href='#f418' class='c016'><sup>[418]</sup></a> found in Cacongo of West
Africa certain “Chibudi, which are men attyred like women and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>behaue themselves womanly, ashamed to be called men; are also
married to men, and esteem that vnnaturale damnation an honor.”
Madagascar also delighted in dancing and singing boys dressed as
girls. In the Empire of Dahomey I noted a corps of prostitutes
kept for the use of the Amazon-soldieresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>North of the Sotadic Zone we find local but notable instances.
Master Christopher Burrough<a id='r419' href='#f419' class='c016'><sup>[419]</sup></a> describes on the western side of the
Volga “a very fine stone castle, called by the name Oueak, and
adioyning to the same a Towne called by the <em>Russes</em>, <em>Sodom</em>,
*&#8196;*&#8196;* which was swallowed into the earth by the iustice of God,
for the wickednesse of the people.” Again: although as a rule
Christianity has steadily opposed pathologic love both in writing
and preaching, there have been remarkable exceptions. Perhaps
the most curious idea was that of certain medical writers in the
middle ages: “<span lang="la">Usus et amplexus pueri, bene temperatus,
salutaris medicina</span>” (Tardieu). Bayle notices (under “Vayer”)
the infamous book of Giovanni della Casa, Archbishop of
Benevento, “<span lang="la">De laudibus Sodomiæ</span>,”<a id='r420' href='#f420' class='c016'><sup>[420]</sup></a> vulgarly known as “<span lang="it">Capitolo
del Forno</span>.” The same writer refers (under “<span lang="fr">Sixte iv</span>”) to the report
that the Dominican Order, which systematically decried <span lang="fr">Le Vice</span>,
had presented a request to the Cardinal di Santa Lucia that
sodomy might be lawful during three months per annum, June to
August; and that the Cardinal had underwritten the petition
“Be it done as they demand.” Hence the Fæda Venus of
Battista Mantovano. Bayle rejects the history for a curious
reason, venery being colder in summer than in winter, and quotes
the proverb “<span lang="fr">Aux mois qui n’ont pas d’ R, peu embrasser et bien
boire</span>.” But in the case of a celibate priesthood such scandals are
inevitable: witness the famous Jesuit epitaph <span lang="fr">Ci-gît un Jésuite, etc.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>In our modern capitals, London, Berlin and Paris for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the Vice seems subject to periodical outbreaks. For many years,
also, England sent her pederasts to Italy, and especially to Naples
whence originated the term “<span lang="it">Il vizio Inglese</span>.” It would be
invidious to detail the scandals which of late years have startled
the public in London and Dublin: for these the curious will
consult the police reports. Berlin, despite her strong flavour of
Phariseeism, Puritanism and Chauvinism in religion, manners and
morals, is not a whit better than her neighbours. Dr. Gaspar,<a id='r421' href='#f421' class='c016'><sup>[421]</sup></a> a
well-known authority on the subject, adduces many interesting
cases especially an old Count Cajus and his six accomplices.
Amongst his many correspondents one suggested to him that not
only Plato and Julius Cæsar but also Winckelmann and Platen (?)
belonged to the Society; and he had found it flourishing in Palermo,
the Louvre, the Scottish Highlands and St. Petersburg, to name
only a few places. Frederick the Great is said to have addressed
these words to his nephew, “<span lang="fr">Je puis vous assurer, par mon
expérience personnelle<a id='t248'></a>, que ce plaisir est peu agréable à cultiver</span>.”
This suggests the popular anecdote of Voltaire and the Englishman
who agreed upon an “experience” and found it far from
satisfactory. A few days afterwards the latter informed the Sage
of Ferney that he had tried it again and provoked the exclamation,
“Once a philospher: twice a sodomite!” The last revival
of the kind in Germany is a society at Frankfort and its neighbourhood,

<p class='c000'>Paris is by no means more depraved than Berlin and London;
but, whilst the latter hushes up the scandal, Frenchmen do not:
hence we see a more copious account of it submitted to the public.
For France of the xviith century consult the “<span lang="fr">Histoire de la
Prostitution chez tous les Peuples du Monde</span>,” and “<span lang="fr">La France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>devenue Italienne</span>,” a treatise which generally follows “<span lang="fr">L’Histoire
Amoureuse des Gaules</span>” by Bussy, Comte de Rabutin.<a id='r422' href='#f422' class='c016'><sup>[422]</sup></a> The
head-quarters of male prostitution were then in the Champ Flory, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i>,
Champ de Flore, the privileged rendezvous of low courtesans. In
the xviiith century, “<span lang="fr">quand le Français à<a id='t249'></a> tête folle</span>,” as Voltaire
sings, invented the term “Péché philosophique,” there was a
temporary recrudescence; and, after the death of Pidauzet de
Mairobert (March, 1779), his “<span lang="fr">Apologie de la Secte Anandryne</span>”
was published in L’Espion Anglais. In those days the Allée des
Veuves in the Champs Elysees had a <span lang="fr">“fief reservé des Ebugors”<a id='r423' href='#f423' class='c016'><sup>[423]</sup></a>—“veuve”</span>

dans l’anus un poivre long rouge qui cause une irritation considérable;
on pose sur les échauboulures produites par les orties,

<p class='c000'>The Restoration and the Empire made the police more vigilant
in matters of politics than of morals. The favourite club, which
had its mot de passe, was in the Rue Doyenne, old quarter St.
Thomas des Louvre; and the house was a hôtel of the xviith century.
Two street-doors, on the right for the male gynæceum and the left
for the female, opened at 4 p.m. in winter and 8 p.m. in summer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>A decoy-lad, charmingly dressed in women’s clothes, with big
haunches and small waist, promenaded outside; and this continued
till 1826 when the police put down the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under Louis Philippe, the conquest of Algiers had evil results,
according to the Marquis de Boissy. He complained without
ambages of <span lang="fr">mœurs</span> Arabes in French regiments, and declared that
the result of the African wars was an <span lang="fr">éffrayable débordement
pédérastique</span>, even as the <span lang="fr">vérole</span> resulted from the Italian campaigns
of that age of passion, the xvith century. From the military
the <span lang="fr">fléau</span> spread to civilian society and the Vice took such expansion
and intensity that it may be said to have been democratised
in cities and large towns; at least so we gather from the <span lang="fr">Dossier
des Agissements des Pédérastes</span>. A general gathering of “<span lang="fr">La
Sainte Congrégation des glorieux Pédérastes</span>” was held in the old
Petite Rue des Marais where, after the theatre, many resorted
under pretext of making water. They ranged themselves along
the walls of a vast garden and exposed their <span lang="la">podices</span>: bourgeois,
richards and nobles came with full purses, touched the part which
most attracted them and were duly followed by it. At the Allée
des Veuves the crowd was dangerous from 7 to 8 p.m.: no policeman
or <span lang="fr">ronde de nuit</span> dared venture in it; cords were stretched
from tree to tree and armed guards drove away strangers amongst
whom, they say, was once Victor Hugo. This nuisance was at
length suppressed by the municipal administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Empire did not improve morals. Balls of sodomites were
held at No. 8 Place de la Madeleine where, on Jan. 2, ’64, some
one hundred and fifty men met, all so well dressed as women
that even the landlord did not recognise them. There was also a
club for sotadic debauchery called the Cent Gardes and the Dragons
de l’Impératrice.<a id='r427' href='#f427' class='c016'><sup>[427]</sup></a> They copied the imperial toilette and kept it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the general wardrobe: hence “<span lang="fr">faire l’Impératrice</span>” meant to be
used carnally. The site, a splendid hotel in the Alleé des
Veuves, was discovered by the Procureur-Général who registered
all the names; but, as these belonged to not a few senators and
dignitaries, the Emperor wisely quashed proceedings. The club
was broken up on July 16, ’64. During the same year La Petite
Revue, edited by M. Loredan Larchy, son of the General, printed
an article, “<span lang="fr">Les échappés de Sodome</span>”: it discusses the letter of
M. Castagnary to the Progrès de Lyons and declares that the
Vice had been adopted by <span lang="fr">plusieurs corps de troupes</span>. For its
latest developments as regards the <i><span lang="fr">chantage</span></i> of the <i><span lang="fr">tantes</span></i> (pathics),
the reader will consult the last issues of Dr. Tardieu’s well-known
Études.<a id='r428' href='#f428' class='c016'><sup>[428]</sup></a> He declares that the servant-class is most infected;
and that the Vice is commonest between the ages of fifteen and
twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pederasty of The Nights may briefly be distributed into
three categories. The first is the funny form, as the unseemly
practical joke of masterful Queen Budúr (vol. iii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52564/52564-h/52564-h.htm#Page_300">300</a>–306) and
the not less <span lang="fr">hardi</span> jest of the slave-princess Zumurrud (vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_226">226</a>).
The second is in the grimmest and most earnest phase of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>perversion, for instance where Abu Nowas<a id='r429' href='#f429' class='c016'><sup>[429]</sup></a> debauches the three
youths (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_64">64</a>–69); whilst in the third form it is wisely and
learnedly discussed, to be severely blamed, by the Shaykhah or
Reverend Woman (vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_154">154</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude this part of my subject, the <span lang="fr">éclaircissement des
obscénités</span>. Many readers will regret the absence from The Nights
of that modesty which distinguishes “Amadis de Gaul;” whose
author when leaving a man and a maid together says, “And
nothing shall be here related; for these and suchlike things which
are conformable neither to good conscience nor nature, man ought
in reason lightly to pass over, holding them in slight esteem as
they deserve.” Nor have we less respect for Palmerin of England
who after a risqué scene declares, “Herein is no offence offered
to the wise by wanton speeches, or encouragement to the loose
by lascivious matter.” But these are not oriental ideas and we
must e’en take the Eastern as we find him. He still holds
“<span lang="la">Naturalia non sunt turpia</span>,” together with “<span lang="la">Mundis omnia munda</span>”;
and, as Bacon assures us the mixture of a lie doth add to pleasure,
so the Arab enjoys the startling and lively contrast of extreme
virtue and horrible vice placed in juxtaposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who have read through these ten volumes will agree
with me that the proportion of offensive matter bears a very
small ratio to the mass of the work. In an age saturated with
cant and hypocrisy, here and there a venal pen will mourn over
the “Pornography” of The Nights, dwell upon the “Ethics of
Dirt” and the “Garbage of the Brothel;” and will lament the
“wanton dissemination (!) of ancient and filthy fiction.” This self-constituted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Censor morum reads Aristophanes and Plato, Horace
and Virgil, perhaps even Martial and Petronius, because “veiled in
the decent obscurity of a learned language;” he allows men
<span lang="la">Latinè loqui</span>; but he is scandalised at stumbling-blocks much
less important in plain English. To be consistent he must begin
by bowdlerising not only the classics, with which boys’ and youths’
minds and memories are soaked and saturated at schools and
colleges, but also Boccaccio and Chaucer, Shakespeare and Rabelais;
Burton, Sterne, Swift and a long list of works which are
yearly reprinted and republished without a word of protest.
Lastly, why does not this inconsistent puritan purge the Old
Testament of its allusions to human ordure and the pudenda;
to carnal copulation and impudent whoredom, to adultery and
fornication, to onanism, sodomy and bestiality? But this he will
not do, the whited sepulchre! To the interested critic of the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> (No. 335 of July, 1886), I return my warmest
thanks for his direct and deliberate falsehoods:—lies are one-legged
and short-lived, and venom evaporates.<a id='r430' href='#f430' class='c016'><sup>[430]</sup></a> It appears to me
that when I show to such men, so “respectable” and so impure,
a landscape of magnificent prospects whose vistas are adorned
with every charm of nature and art, they point their unclean noses
at a little heap of muck here and there lying in a field-corner.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>§ V<br > ON THE PROSE-RHYME AND THE POETRY OF THE NIGHTS.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>A.—<span class='sc'>The Saj’a.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>According to promise in my Foreword (p. xiv.), I here proceed
to offer a few observations concerning the Saj’a or rhymed prose
and the Shi’r, or measured sentence, that is, the verse of The
Nights. The former has in composition, metrical or unmetrical,
three distinct forms. Saj’a mutawázi (parallel), the most common,
is when the ending words of sentences agree in measure,
assonance and final letter, in fact our full rhyme: next is Saj’a
mutarraf (the affluent), when the periods, hemistichs or couplets
end in words whose terminal letters correspond, although differing
in measure and number; and thirdly, Saj’a muwázanah (equilibrium)
is applied to the balance which affects words corresponding
in measure but differing in final letters.<a id='r431' href='#f431' class='c016'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Al-Saj’a, the fine style or style <span lang="fr">fleuri</span>, also termed Al-Badí’a, or
euphuism, is the basis of all Arabic euphony. The whole of the
Koran is written in it; and the same is the case with the Makámát
of Al-Hariri and the prime master-pieces of rhetorical composition:
without it no translation of the Holy Book can be satisfactory
or final, and where it is not the Assemblies become the prose
of prose. Thus universally used the assonance has necessarily
been abused, and its excess has given rise to the saying “Al-Saj’a
faj’a”—prose rhyme’s a pest. English translators have, unwisely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>I think, agreed in rejecting it, while Germans have not. Mr.
Preston assures us that “rhyming prose is extremely ungraceful in
English and introduces an air of flippancy”: this was certainly
not the case with Friedrich Rückert’s version of the great original,
and I see no reason why it should be so or become so in our
tongue. Torrens (Pref. p. vii.) declares that “the effect of the
irregular sentence with the iteration of a jingling rhyme is not
pleasant in our language:” he therefore systematically neglects it
and gives his style the semblance of being “scamped” with the
object of saving study and trouble. Mr. Payne (ix. 379) deems it
an “excrescence born of the excessive facilities for rhyme afforded
by the language,” and of Eastern delight in antithesis of all kinds
whether of sound or of thought; and, aiming elaborately at grace
of style, he omits it wholly, even in the proverbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weight of authority was against me but my plan compelled
me to disregard it. The dilemma was simply either to use the
Saj’a or to follow Mr. Payne’s method and “arrange the disjecta
membra of the original in their natural order;” that is to remodel
the text. Intending to produce a faithful copy of the Arabic, I
was compelled to adopt the former and still hold it to be the
better alternative. Moreover I question Mr. Payne’s dictum
(ix. 383) that “the Seja-form is utterly foreign to the genius of
English prose and that its preservation would be fatal to all
vigour and harmony of style.” The English translator of Palmerin
of England, Anthony Munday, attempted it in places with great
success as I have before noted (vol. viii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55091/55091-h/55091-h.htm#Page_60">60</a>); and my late friend
Edward Eastwick made artistic use of it in his Gulistan. Had I
rejected the “Cadence of the cooing-dove” because un-English, I
should have adopted the balanced periods of the Anglican
marriage service<a id='r432' href='#f432' class='c016'><sup>[432]</sup></a> or the essentially English system of alliteration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>requiring some such artful aid to distinguish from the vulgar
recitative style the elevated and classical tirades in The Nights.
My attempt has found with reviewers more favour than I expected;
and a kindly critic writes of it, “These melodious fragments, these
little eddies of song set like gems in the prose, have a charming
effect on the ear. They come as dulcet surprises and mostly
recur in highly-wrought situations, or they are used to convey a
vivid sense of something exquisite in nature or art. Their introduction
seems due to whim or caprice, but really it arises from a
profound study of the situation, as if the Tale-teller felt suddenly
compelled to break into the rhythmic strain.”</p>

<h4 class='c019'>B.—<span class='sc'>The Verse.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Shi’r or metrical part of The Nights is considerable,
amounting to not less than ten thousand lines and these I could
not but render in rhyme or rather in monorhyme. This portion
has been a bugbear to translators. De Sacy noticed the difficulty
of the task (p. <a href='#Page_283'>283</a>). Lane held the poetry untranslatable because
abounding in the figure Tajnís, our paronomasia or paragram, of
which there are seven distinct varieties,<a id='r433' href='#f433' class='c016'><sup>[433]</sup></a> not to speak of other
rhetorical flourishes. He therefore omitted the greater part of the
verse as tedious and, through the loss of measure and rhyme,
“generally intolerable to the reader.” He proved his position by
the bald literalism of the passages which he rendered in truly
prosaic prose and succeeded in changing the facies and presentment
of the work. For the Shi’r, like the Saj’a, is not introduced
arbitrarily; and its unequal distribution throughout The Nights may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>be accounted for by rule of art. Some tales, like Omar bin
al-Nu’man and Tawaddud, contain very little because the theme is
historical or realistic; whilst in stories of love and courtship, as that
of Rose-in-hood, the proportion may rise to one-fifth of the whole.
And this is true to nature. Love, as Addison said, makes even
the mechanic (the British mechanic!) poetical, and Joe Hume of
material memory once fought a duel about a fair object of dispute.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before discussing the verse of The Nights it may be advisable to
enlarge a little upon the prosody of the Arabs. We know nothing
of the origin of their poetry, which is lost in the depths of
antiquity, and the oldest bards of whom we have any remains
belong to the famous epoch of the war Al-Basús, which would
place them about A.D. 500. Moreover, when the Muse of Arabia
first shows she is not only fully developed and mature, she has lost
all her first youth, her <span lang="fr">beauté du diable</span>, and she is assuming the
characteristics of an age beyond “middle age.” No one can
study the earliest poetry without perceiving that it results from
the cultivation of centuries and that it has already assumed that
artificial type and conventional process of treatment which presages
inevitable decay. Its noblest period is included in the century
preceding the Apostolate of Mohammed and the oldest of that
epoch is the prince of Arab songsters, Imr al-Kays, “The Wandering
King.” The Christian Fathers characteristically termed poetry
<span lang="la">Vinum Dæmonorum</span>. The stricter Moslems called their bards
“enemies of Allah;” and when the Prophet, who hated verse and
could not even quote it correctly, was asked who was the best poet
of the Peninsula he answered that the “Man of Al-Kays,” <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the
worshipper of the Priapus-idol, would usher them all into Hell.
Here he only echoed the general verdict of his countrymen who
loved poetry and, as a rule, despised poets. The earliest complete
pieces of any volume and substance saved from the wreck of old
Arabic literature and familiar in our day are the seven Kasídahs
(purpose-odes or tendence-elegies) which are popularly known as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the Gilded or the Suspended Poems; and in all of these we find,
with an elaboration of material and formal art which can go no
further, a subject-matter of trite imagery and stock ideas which
suggest a long ascending line of model ancestors and predecessors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scholars are agreed upon the fact that many of the earliest and
best Arab poets were, as Mohammed boasted himself, unalphabetic<a id='r434' href='#f434' class='c016'><sup>[434]</sup></a>
or rather could neither read nor write. They addressed
the ear and the mind, not the eye. They “spoke verse,” learning
it by rote and dictating it to the Ráwi, and this reciter again transmitted
it to the musician whose pipe or zither accompanied the
minstrel’s song. In fact the general practice of writing began
only at the end of the first century after The Flight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rude and primitive measure of Arab song, upon which the
most complicated system of metres subsequently arose, was called
Al-Rajaz, literally “the trembling,” because it reminded the
highly imaginative hearer of a pregnant she-camel’s weak and
tottering steps. This was the carol of the camel-driver, the
lover’s lay and the warrior’s chaunt of the heroic ages; and its
simple, unconstrained flow adapted it well for extempore effusions.
Its merits and demerits have been extensively discussed amongst
Arab grammarians and many, noticing that it was not originally
divided into hemistichs, make an essential difference between the
Shá’ir who speaks poetry and the Rájiz who speaks Rajaz. It
consisted, to describe it technically, of iambic dipodia (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>the first three syllables being optionally long or short. It can
generally be read like our iambs and, being familiar, is pleasant to
the English ear. The dipodia are repeated either twice or thrice;
in the former case Rajaz is held by some authorities, as Al-Akhfash
(Sa’íd ibn Másadah), to be mere prose. Although Labíd and
Antar composed in iambics, the first Kásídah or regular poem in
Rajaz was by Al-Aghlab al-Ajibi temp. Mohammed: the Alfíyah-grammar
of Ibn Málik is in Rajaz Muzdawij, the hemistichs
rhyming and the assonance being confined to the couplet. Al-Hariri
also affects Rajaz in the third and fifth Assemblies. So
far Arabic metre is true to Nature: in impassioned speech the
movement of language is iambic: we say “I <em>will</em>, I <em>will</em>,” not
“I will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For many generations the Sons of the Desert were satisfied
with Nature’s teaching; the fine perceptions and the nicely trained
ear of the bard needing no aid from art. But in time came the
inevitable prosodist under the formidable name of Abu Abd al-Rahmán
al-Khalíl, i. Ahmad, i. Amrú, i. Tamím al-Faráhidi (of
the Faráhid sept), al-Azdi (of the Azd clan), al-Yahmadi (of the
Yahmad tribe), popularly known as Al-Khalíl ibn Ahmad al-Basri,
of Bassorah, where he died æt. 68, scanning verses they say, in
A.H. 170 (= 786–87). Ibn Khallikán relates (i. 493) on the
authority of Hamzah al-Isfaháni how this “father of Arabic
grammar and discoverer of the rules of prosody” invented the
science as he walked past a coppersmith’s shop on hearing the
strokes of a hammer upon a metal basin: “two objects devoid of
any quality which could serve as a proof and an illustration of
anything else than their own form and shape and incapable of
leading to any other knowledge than that of their own nature.”<a id='r435' href='#f435' class='c016'><sup>[435]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>According to others he was passing through the Fullers’ Bazar at
Basrah when his ear was struck by the Dak-dak (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">دق دق</span>) and
the Dakak-dakak (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">دقق دقق</span>) of the workmen. In these two
onomatopoetics we trace the expression which characterises the Arab
tongue: all syllables are composed of consonant and vowel, the
latter long or short as Bā and Bă; or of a vowelled consonant
followed by a consonant as Bal, Bau (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">بو</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The grammarian, true to the traditions of his craft which looks for
all poetry to the Badawi,<a id='r436' href='#f436' class='c016'><sup>[436]</sup></a> adopted for metrical details the language
of the Desert. The distich, which amongst Arabs is looked upon as
one line, he named “Bayt,” nighting-place, tent or house; and the
hemistich Misrá’ah, the one leaf of a folding door. To this “scenic”
simile all the parts of the verse were more or less adapted. The
metres, our feet, were called “Arkán,” the stakes and stays of the
tent; the syllables were “Usúl” or roots divided into three kinds:
the first or “Sabab” (the tent-rope) is composed of two letters, a
vowelled and a quiescent consonant as “Lam.”<a id='r437' href='#f437' class='c016'><sup>[437]</sup></a> The “Watad”
or tent-peg of three letters is of two varieties; the Majmú’, or
united, a foot in which the two first consonants are moved by
vowels and the last is jazmated or made quiescent by apocope as
“Lakad;” and the Mafrúk, or disunited, when the two moved consonants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>are separated by one jazmated, as “Kabla.” And lastly
the “Fásilah” or intervening space, applied to the main pole of
the tent, consists of four letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The metres were called Buhúr or “seas” (plur. of Bahr), also
meaning the space within the tent-walls, the equivoque alluding to
pearls and other treasures of the deep. Al-Khalil, the systematiser,
found in general use only five Dáirah (circles, classes or groups of
metre); and he characterised the harmonious and stately measures,
all built upon the original Rajaz, as Al-Tawíl (the long)<a id='r438' href='#f438' class='c016'><sup>[438]</sup></a>, Al-Kámil
(the complete), Al-Wáfir (the copious), Al-Basít (the
extended) and Al-Khafíf (the light).<a id='r439' href='#f439' class='c016'><sup>[439]</sup></a> These embrace all the
Mu’allakát and the Hamásah, the great Anthology of Abú Tammám;
but the crave for variety and the extension of foreign intercourse
had multiplied wants and Al-Khalil deduced, from the
original five Dáirah, fifteen, to which Al-Akhfash (ob. A.D. 830)
added a sixteenth, Al-Khabab. The Persians extended the number
to nineteen: the first four were peculiarly Arab; the fourteenth,
the fifteenth and seventeenth peculiarly Persian and all the rest
were Arab and Persian.<a id='r440' href='#f440' class='c016'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Arabic metre so far resembles that of Greece and Rome that
the value of syllables depends upon the “quantity” or position of
their consonants, not upon accent as in English and the Neo-Latin
tongues. Al-Khalil was doubtless familiar with the classic
prosody of Europe but he rejected it as unsuited to the genius
of Arabic and like a true Eastern Gelehrte he adopted a process
devised by himself. Instead of scansion by pyrrhics and spondees,
iambs and trochees, anapaests and similar simplifications he
invented a system of weights (“wuzún”). Of these there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>nine<a id='r441' href='#f441' class='c016'><sup>[441]</sup></a> memorial words used as quantitive signs, all built upon
the root “fa’l” which has rendered such notable service to Arabic
and Hebrew<a id='r442' href='#f442' class='c016'><sup>[442]</sup></a> grammar and varying from the simple “fa’ál,” in
Persian “fa’úl,” (<span class='meter'>⏓&nbsp;‑</span>) to the complicated “Mutafá’ilun”
(<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), anapaest + iamb. Thus the prosodist would scan the
Shahnámeh of Firdausi as</p>

<p class='c000'>These weights also show another peculiarity of Arabic verse. In
English we have few if any spondees: the Arabic contains about
three longs to one short; hence its gravity, stateliness and dignity.
But these longs again are peculiar, and sometimes strike the
European ear as shorts, thus adding a difficulty for those who
would represent Oriental metres by western feet, ictus and accent.
German Arabists can register an occasional success in such
attempts: Englishmen none. My late friend Professor Palmer of
Cambridge tried the tour de force of dancing on one leg instead of
two and notably failed: Mr. Lyall also strove to imitate Arabic
metre and produced only prose bewitched.<a id='r443' href='#f443' class='c016'><sup>[443]</sup></a> Mr. Payne appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>to me to have wasted trouble in “observing the exterior form of
the stanza, the movement of the rhyme and (as far as possible)
the identity in number of the syllables composing the beits.”
There is only one part of his admirable version concerning
which I have heard competent readers complain; and that is the
metrical, because here and there it sounds strange to their
ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already stated my conviction that there are two and only
two ways of translating Arabic poetry into English. One is to
represent it by good heroic or lyric verse as did Sir William
Jones; the other is to render it after French fashion, by measured
and balanced Prose, the little sister of Poetry. It is thus and thus
only that we can preserve the peculiar <i><span lang="fr">cachet</span></i> of the original. This
old-world Oriental song is spirit-stirring as a “blast of that dread
horn,” albeit the words be thin. It is heady as the “Golden
Wine” of Libanus, to the tongue water and brandy to the brain—the
clean contrary of our nineteenth century effusions. Technically
speaking, it can be vehicled only by the verse of the old
English ballad or by the prose of the Book of Job. And Badawi
poetry is a perfect expositor of Badawi life, especially in the good
and gladsome old Pagan days ere Al-Islam, like the creed which
it abolished, overcast the minds of men with its dull grey pall of
realistic superstition. They combined to form a marvellous
picture—those contrasts of splendour and squalor amongst the sons
of the sand. Under airs pure as æther, golden and ultramarine
above and melting over the horizon into a diaphanous green which
suggested a reflection of Kaf, that unseen mountain-wall of
emerald, the so-called Desert changed face twice a year; now
brown and dry as summer-dust; then green as Hope, beautified
with infinite verdure and broad sheetings of rain-water. The
vernal and autumnal shiftings of camp, disruptions of homesteads
and partings of kith and kin, friends and lovers, made the life
many-sided as it was vigorous and noble, the outcome of hardy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>frames, strong minds and spirits breathing the very essence of
liberty and independence. The day began with the dawn-drink,
“generous wine bought with shining ore,” poured into the crystal
goblet from the leather bottle swinging before the cooling breeze.
The rest was spent in the practice of weapons; in the favourite
arrow-game known as Al-Maysar, gambling which at least had the
merit of feeding the poor; in racing for which the Badawin had a
mania, and in the chase, the foray and the fray which formed the
serious business of his life. And how picturesque the hunting
scenes; the greyhound, like the mare, of purest blood; the falcon
cast at francolin and coney; the gazelle standing at gaze; the
desert ass scudding over the ground-waves; the wild cows or
bovine antelopes browsing with their calves and the ostrich-chickens
flocking round the parent bird! The Musámarah or
night-talk round the camp-fire was enlivened by the lute-girl and
the gleeman, whom the austere Prophet described as “roving distraught
in every vale” and whose motto in Horatian vein was,
“To-day we shall drink, to-morrow be sober; wine this day, that
day work.” Regularly once a year, during the three peaceful
months when war and even blood revenge were held sacrilegious,
the tribes met at Ukádh (Ocaz) and other fairsteads, where they
held high festival and the bards strave in song and prided themselves
upon doing honour to women and to the successful warriors
of their tribe. Brief, the object of Arab life was to <em>be</em>—to be free,
to be brave, to be wise; while the endeavours of other peoples
was and is to <em>have</em>—to have wealth, to have knowledge, to have a
name; and while moderns make their “epitome of life” to be, to
do and to <em>suffer</em>. Lastly the Arab’s end was honourable as his
life was stirring: few Badawin had the crowning misfortune of
dying “the straw-death.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The poetical forms in The Nights are as follows:—The Misrá’ah
or hemistich is half the “Bayt” which, for want of a better word
I have rendered couplet: this, however, though formally separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>in MSS. is looked upon as one line, one verse; hence a word can
be divided, the former part pertaining to the first and the latter to
the second moiety of the distich. As the Arabs ignore blank
verse, when we come upon a rhymeless couplet we know that it is
an extract from a longer composition in monorhyme. The Kit’ah
is a fragment, either an occasional piece or more frequently a
portion of a Ghazal (ode) or Kasídah (elegy), other than the Matlá,
the initial Bayt with rhyming distichs. The Ghazal and Kasídah
differ mainly in length: the former is popularly limited to
eighteen couplets: the latter begins at fifteen and is of indefinite
number. Both are built upon monorhyme, which appears twice
in the first couplet and ends all the others, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, aa + ba + ca,
etc.; nor may the same assonance be repeated, unless at least seven
couplets intervene. In the best poets, as in the old classic verse
of France, the sense must be completed in one couplet and not
run on to a second; and, as the parts cohere very loosely,
separate quotation can generally be made without injuring their
proper effect. A favourite form is the Rubá’í or quatrain, made
familiar to English ears by Mr. Fitzgerald’s masterly adaptation
of Omar-i-Khayyám: the movement is generally aa + ba; but it
also appears as ab + cb, in which case it is a Kit’ah or fragment.
The Murabbá, tetrastichs or four-fold song, occurs once only in The
Nights (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_98">98</a>); it is a succession of double Bayts or of four-lined
stanzas rhyming aa + bc + dc + ec: in strict form the
first three hemistichs rhyme with one another only, independently
of the rest of the poem, and the fourth with that of every other
stanza, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, aa + ab + cb + db. The Mukhammas, cinquains
or pentastichs (Night cmlxiv.), represents a stanza of two distichs
and a hemistich in monorhyme, the fifth line being the “bob” or
burden: each succeeding stanza affects a new rhyme, except in the
fifth line, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, aaaab + ccccb + ddddb and so forth. The Muwwál
is a simple popular song in four to six lines; specimens of it are
given in the Egyptian grammar of my friend the late Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Wilhelm Spitta.<a id='r444' href='#f444' class='c016'><sup>[444]</sup></a> The Muwashshah, or ornamented verse, has
two main divisions: one applies to our acrostics in which the
initials form a word or words; the other is a kind of Musaddas, or
sex-tines, which occurs once only in The Nights (cmlxxxvii.) It
consists of three couplets or six-line strophes: all the hemistichs of
the first are in monorhyme; in the second and following stanzas
the three first hemistichs take a new rhyme, but the fourth resumes
the assonance of the first set and is followed by the third couplet of
No. 1, serving as bob or refrain, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, aaaaaa + bbbaaa + cccaaa
and so forth. It is the most complicated of all the measures and
is held to be of Morisco or Hispano-Moorish origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lane (Lex.) lays down, on the lines of Ibn Khallikan
(i. 476, etc.) and other representative literati, as our sole authorities
for pure Arabic, the precedence in following order. First of
all ranks the Jáhili (Ignoramus) of The Ignorance, the <span lang="grc">Ἀραβίας ἄρειον
ἔθνος</span>: these pagans left hemistichs, couplets, pieces and elegies which
once composed a large corpus and which is now mostly forgotten.
Hammád al-Ráwiyah, the Reciter, a man of Persian descent
(ob. A.H. 160 = 777) who first collected the Mu’allakát, once
recited by rote in a séance before Caliph Al-Walid two thousand
poems of præ-Mohammedan bards.<a id='r445' href='#f445' class='c016'><sup>[445]</sup></a> After the Jáhili stands the
Mukhadram or Muhadrim, the “Spurious,” because half Pagan
half Moslem, who flourished either immediately before or soon
after the preaching of Mohammed. The Islámi or full-blooded
Moslem at the end of the first century A.H. (= 720) began the
process of corruption in language; and, lastly, he was followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>by the Muwallad of the second century who fused Arabic with
non-Arabic and in whom purity of diction disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have noticed (1 § A.) that the versical portion of The Nights
may be distributed into three categories. First are the olden
poems which are held classical by all modern Arabs; then comes
the mediæval poetry, the effusions of that brilliant throng which
adorned the splendid Court of Harun al-Rashid and which ended
with Al-Haríri (ob. A.H. 516); and, lastly, are the various <i><span lang="fr">pièces de
circonstance</span></i> suggested to editors or scribes by the occasion. It is
not my object to enter upon the historical part of the subject:
a mere sketch would have neither value nor interest whilst a
finished picture would lead too far: I must be contented to notice
a few of the most famous names.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the præ-islamites we have Ádi bin Zayd al-Ibadi the
“celebrated poet” of Ibn Kkallikán (i. 188); Nábighat (the
full-grown) al-Zubyáni who flourished at the Court of Al-Nu’man
in A.D. 580–602, and whose poem is compared with the
“Suspendeds,”<a id='r446' href='#f446' class='c016'><sup>[446]</sup></a> and Al-Mutalammis the “pertinacious” satirist,
friend and intimate with Tarafah of the “Prize Poem.” About
Mohammed’s day we find Imr al-Kays “with whom poetry began,”
to end with Zú al-Rummah; Amrú bin Mádi Karab al-Zubaydi,
Labíd; Ka’b ibn Zuhayr, the father one of the Mu’allakah-poets,
and the son author of the Burdah or Mantle-poem (see vol. iv. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53254/53254-h/53254-h.htm#Page_115">115</a>),
and Abbás bin Mirdás who lampooned the Prophet and had “his
tongue cut out” <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> received a double share of booty from Ali.
In the days of Caliph Omar we have Alkamah bin Olátha followed
by Jamíl bin Ma’mar of the Banu Ozrah (ob. A.H. 82), who loved
Azzá. Then came Al-Kuthayyir (the dwarf, <em>ironicè</em>), the lover of
Buthaynah, “who was so lean that birds might be cut to bits with
her bones:” the latter was also a poetess (Ibn Khall. i. 87), like
Hind bint al-Nu’man who made herself so disagreeable to Al-Hajjáj
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>(ob. A.H. 95). Jarír al-Khatafah, the noblest of the Islami poets in
the first century, is noticed at full length by Ibn Khallikan (i. 294)
together with his rival in poetry and debauchery, Abú Firás
Hammám or Homaym bin Ghalib al-Farazdak, the Tamími,
the Ommiade poet “without whose verse half Arabic would
be lost<a id='r447' href='#f447' class='c016'><sup>[447]</sup></a>:” he exchanged satires with Jarír and died forty days
before him (A.H. 110). Another contemporary, forming the
poetical triumvirate of the period, was the debauched Christian
poet Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi. They were followed by Al-Ahwas
al-Ansári whose witty lampoons banished him to Dahlak Island
in the Red Sea (ob. A.H. 179 = 795); by Bashshár ibn Burd and
by Yúnus ibn Habib (ob. A.H. 182).</p>

<p class='c000'>The well-known names of the Harun-cycle are Al-Asma’i,
rhetorician and poet, whose epic with Antar for hero is not forgotten
(ob. A.H. 216); Isaac of Mosul (Ishak bin Ibrahim of
Persian origin); Al-’Utbi “the Poet” (ob. A.H. 228); Abu al-Abbás
al-Rakáshi; Abu al-Atahiyah, the lover of Otbah; Muslim bin
al-Walíd al-Ansari; Abú Tammám of Tay, compiler of the
Hamásah (ob. A.H. 230), “a Muwallad of the first class” (says
Ibn Khallikan i. 392); the famous or infamous Abu Nowás; Abu
Mus’ab (Ahmad ibn Ali) who died in A.H. 242; the satirist Dibil
al-Khuzáí (ob. A.H. 246) and a host of others <span lang="la">quos nunc
perscribere longum est</span>. They were followed by Al-Bohtori “the
Poet” (ob. A.H. 286); the royal author Abdullah ibn al-Mu’tazz
(ob. A.H. 315); Ibn Abbád the Sahib (ob. A.H. 334); Mansúr
al-Halláj the martyred Sufi; the Sahib ibn Abbad; Abu Faras
al-Hamdáni (ob. A.H. 357); Al-Námi (ob. A.H. 399) who had
many encounters with that model Chauvinist Al-Mutanabbi,
nicknamed Al-Mutanabbih (the “wide-awake”), killed A.H. 354;
Al-Manázi of Manazjird (ob. A.H.<a id='t269'></a> 427); Al-Tughrai author of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Lámiyat al-’Ajam (ob. A.H. 375); Al-Haríri the model rhetorician
(ob. A.H. 516); Al-Hájiri al-Irbili, of Arbela (ob. A.H. 632);
Bahá al-Din al-Sinjari, (ob. A.H. 622); Al-Kátib or the Scribe
(ob. A.H. 656); Abdun al-Andalúsi the Spaniard (our xiith
century) and about the same time Al-Náwaji, author of the Halbat
al-Kumayt or “Race-course of the Bay-horse”—poetical slang for
wine.<a id='r448' href='#f448' class='c016'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the third category, the pièces d’occasion, little need be said:
I may refer readers to my notes on the doggrels in vol. ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_34">34</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_35">35</a>,

<p class='c000'>Having a mortal aversion to the details of Arabic prosody
I have persuaded my friend Dr. Steingass, to undertake in the
following pages the subject as far as concerns the poetry of The
Nights. He has been kind enough to collaborate with me from
the beginning, and to his minute lexicographical knowledge I am
deeply indebted for discovering not a few blemishes which would
have been “nuts to the critic.” The learned Arabist’s notes will
be highly interesting to students: mine (§ V.) are intended to
give a superficial and popular idea of the Arab’s verse-mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The principle of Arabic Prosody” (called ’Arúz, pattern
standard, or ’Ilm al-’Arúz, science of the ’Arúz), in so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>resembles that of classical poetry, as it chiefly rests on metrical
weight, not on accent, or in other words a verse is measured by
short and long quantities, while the accent only regulates its
rhythm. In Greek and Latin, however, the quantity of the
syllables depends on their vowels, which may be either naturally
short or long, or become long by position, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> if followed by two
or more consonants. We all remember from our school-days
what a fine string of rules had to be committed to and kept in
memory, before we were able to scan a Latin or Greek verse,
without breaking its neck by tripping over false quantities. In
Arabic, on the other hand, the answer to the question, what is
metrically long or short, is exceedingly simple, and flows with
stringent cogency from the nature of the Arabic Alphabet. This,
strictly speaking, knows only consonants (Harf, pl. Hurúf). The
vowels which are required, in order to articulate the consonants,
were at first not represented in writing at all. They had to be
supplied by the reader, and are not improperly called “motions”
(Harakát), because they move or lead on as it were, one letter to
another. They are three in number, a (Fathah), i (Kasrah),
u (Zammah), originally sounded as the corresponding English
vowels in bat, bit and butt respectively, but in certain cases
modifying their pronunciation under the influence of a neighbouring
consonant. When the necessity made itself felt to
represent them in writing, especially for the sake of fixing the
correct reading of the Koran, they were rendered by additional
signs, placed above or beneath the consonant, after which they are
pronounced, in a similar way as it is done in some systems of
English shorthand. A consonant followed by a short vowel
is called a “moved letter” (Muharrakah); a consonant without
such vowel is called “resting” or “quiescent” (Sákinah), and
can stand only at the end of a syllable or word.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now we are able to formulate the <em>one</em> simple rule, which
determines the prosodical quantity in Arabic: any moved letter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>as ta, li, mu, is counted short; any moved letter followed by a
quiescent one, as taf, lun, mus, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> any closed syllable beginning
and terminating with a consonant and having a short vowel
between, forms a long quantity. This is certainly a relief in
comparison with the numerous rules of classical Prosody, proved
by not a few exceptions, which for instance in Dr. Smith’s
elementary Latin Grammar fill eight closely printed pages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I proceed to show how from the prosodical unities, the
moved and the quiescent letter, first the metrical elements, then
the feet and lastly the metres are built up, it will be necessary to
obviate a few misunderstandings, to which our mode of transliterating
Arabic into the Roman character might give rise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

      <div class='line'>“Love in my heart they lit and went their ways,” (vol. i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_232">232</a>)</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>runs in Arabic:</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Akámú al-wajda fí kalbí wa sárú.” (Mac. Ed. i. 179).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here, according to our ideas, the word akámú would begin with
a short vowel a, and contain two long vowels á and ú; according
to Arabic views neither is the case. The word begins with
“Alif,” and its second syllable ká closes in Alif after Fathah (a),
in the same way, as the third syllable mú closes in the letter Wáw
(w) after Zammah (u).</p>

<p class='c000'>The question, therefore, arises, what is “Alif.” It is the first
of the twenty-eight Arabic letters, and has through the medium
of the Greek Alpha nominally entered into our alphabet, where it
now plays rather a misleading part. Curiously enough, however,
Greek itself has preserved for us the key to the real nature of the
letter. In <span lang="grc">Ἀλφα</span> the initial a is preceded by the so-called <span lang="la">spiritus
lenis</span> (᾿), a sign which must be placed in front or at the top of any
vowel beginning a Greek word, and which represents that slight
aspiration or soft breathing almost involuntarily uttered, when we
try to pronounce a vowel by itself. We need not go far to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>how deeply rooted this tendency is and to what exaggerations it
will sometimes lead. Witness the gentleman, who after mentioning
that he had been visiting his “favourite haunts” on the
scenes of his early life, was sympathetically asked, how the
dear old ladies were. This <span lang="la">spiritus lenis</span> is the silent h of the
French “<span lang="fr">homme</span>” and the English “honour,” corresponding
exactly to the Arabic Hamzah, whose mere prop the Alif is, when
it stands at the beginning of a word: a native Arabic Dictionary
does not begin with Báb al-Alif (Gate or Chapter of the Alif), but
with Báb al-Hamzah. What the Greeks call Alpha and have
transmitted to us as a name for the vowel a, is in fact nothing
else but the Arabic Hamzah-Alif (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أ</span>&#8239;), moved by Fathah, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i>
bearing the sign <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ﹷ</span> for a at
the top (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أَ</span>&#8239;), just as it might have the
sign Zammah (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ﹹ</span>&#8239;) superscribed
to express u (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أُ</span>&#8239;), or the sign
Kasrah (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ﹻ</span>&#8239;) subjoined
to represent i (&#8239;<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">إِ</span>&#8239;). In each case the
Hamzah-Alif, although scarcely audible to our ear, is the real
letter and might fitly be rendered in transliteration by the above-mentioned
silent h, wherever we make an Arabic word begin with
a vowel not preceded by any other sign. This latter restriction
refers to the sign ’, which in Sir Richard Burton’s translation of
The Nights, as frequently in books published in this country, is
used to represent the Arabic letter <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ع</span> in whose very name ’Ayn
it occurs. The ’Ayn is “described as produced by a smart compression
of the upper part of the windpipe and forcible emission
of breath,” imparting a guttural tinge to a following or preceding
vowel-sound; but it is by no means a mere guttural vowel, as
Professor Palmer styles it. For Europeans, who do not belong
to the Israelitic dispensation, as well as for Turks and Persians,
its exact pronunciation is most difficult, if not impossible to
acquire.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading Arabic from transliteration for the purpose of
scanning poetry, we have therefore in the first instance to keep
in mind that no Arabic word or syllable can begin with a vowel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Where our mode of rendering Arabic in the Roman character
would make this appear to be the case, either Hamzah (silent h),
or ’Ayn (represented by the sign ’) is the real initial, and the only
element to be taken in account as a <em>letter</em>. It follows as a self-evident
corollary that wherever a single consonant stands between
two vowels, it never closes the previous syllable, but always
opens the next one. Our word “Akámú,” for instance, can only
be divided into the syllables: A (properly Ha)-ká-mú, never into
Ak-á-mú or Ak-ám-ú.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been stated above that the syllable ká is closed by the
letter Alif after Fathah, in the same way as the syllable mú is
closed by the letter Wáw, and I may add now, as the word fí is
closed by the letter Yá (y). To make this perfectly clear, I must
repeat that the Arabic Alphabet, as it was originally written, deals
only with consonants. The signs for the short vowel-sounds were
added later for a special purpose, and are generally not represented
even in printed books, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> in the various editions of The
Nights, where only quotations from the Koran or poetical passages
are provided with the vowel-points. But among those consonants
there are three, called weak letters (Hurúf al-’illah), which have a
particular organic affinity to these vowel-sounds: the guttural
Hamzah, which is akin to a, the palatal Yá, which is related to <em>i</em>,
and the labial Wáw, which is homogeneous with u. Where any
of the weak letters follows a vowel of its own class, either at the
end of a word or being itself followed by another consonant, it
draws out or lengthens the preceding vowel and is in this sense
called a letter of prolongation (Harf al-Madd). Thus, bearing in
mind that the Hamzah is in reality a silent h, the syllable ká
might be written kah, similarly to the German word “<span lang="de">sah</span>,” where
the h is not pronounced either, but imparts a lengthened sound
to the a. In like manner mú and fí are written in Arabic muw
and fiy respectively, and form long quantities not because they
contain a vowel long by nature, but because their initial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Muharrakah” is followed by a “Sákinah,” exactly as in the
previously mentioned syllables taf, lun, mus.<a id='r449' href='#f449' class='c016'><sup>[449]</sup></a> In the Roman
transliteration, Akámú forms a word of five letters, two of which
are consonants, and three vowels; in Arabic it represents the
combination H(a)k(a)hm(u)w, consisting also of five letters but
all consonants, the intervening vowels being expressed in writing
either merely by superadded external signs, or more frequently
not at all. Metrically it represents one short and two long
quantities (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), forming in Latin a trisyllabic foot, called
Bacchíus, and in Arabic a quinqueliteral “Rukn” (pillar) or
“Juz” (part, portion), the technical designation for which we
shall introduce presently.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one important remark more to be made with regard
to the Hamzah: at the beginning of a word it is either conjunctive,
Hamzat al-Wasl, or disjunctive, Hamzat al Kat’. The
difference is best illustrated by reference to the French so-called
aspirated h, as compared with the above mentioned silent h. If
the latter, as initial of a noun, is preceded by the article, the
article loses its vowel, and, ignoring the silent h altogether, is
read with the following noun almost as one word: <span lang="fr">le homme</span>
becomes <span lang="fr">l’homme</span> (pronounced lomme) as <span lang="fr">le ami</span> becomes <span lang="fr">l’ami</span>.
This resembles very closely the Arabic Hamzah Wasl. If, on
the other hand, a French word begins with an aspirated h, as
for instance héros, the article does not drop its vowel before the
noun, nor is the h sounded as in the English word “hero,” but
the effect of the aspirate is simply to keep the two vowel sounds
apart, so as to pronounce <span lang="fr">le éros</span> with a slight hiatus between,
and this is exactly what happens in the case of the Arabic
Hamzah Kat’.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the Wasl, however, Arabic goes a step further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>than French. In the French example, quoted above, we have
seen it is the silent h and the <em>preceding</em> vowel, which are
eliminated; in Arabic both the Hamzah and its own Harakah,
<i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the short vowel <em>following</em> it, are supplanted by their
antecedent. Another example will make this clear. The
most common instance of the Hamzah Wasl is the article al
(for h(a)l = the Hebrew hal), where it is moved by Fathah.
But it has this sound only at the beginning of a sentence
or speech, as in “Al-hamdu” at the head of the Fatihah, or in
“Alláhu” at the beginning of the third Surah. If the two words
stand in grammatical connection, as in the sentence “Praise be
to God,” we cannot say “Al-Hamdu li-Alláhi,” but the junction
(Wasl) between the dative particle li and the noun which it
governs must take place. According to the French principle, this
junction would be effected at the cost of the preceding element
and li Alláhi would become l’Alláhí; in Arabic, on the contrary,
the kasrated l of the particle takes the place of the following
fathated Hamzah and we read li ’lláhi instead. Proceeding in the
Fatihah we meet with the verse “Iyyáka na’budu wa iyyáka
nasta’ínu,” Thee do we worship and of Thee do we ask aid.
Here the Hamzah of iyyáka (properly hiyyáka with silent h) is
disjunctive, and therefore its pronunciation remains the same at
the beginning and in the middle of the sentence, or to put it
differently, instead of coalescing with the preceding wa into
wa’yyáka, the two words are kept separate, by the Hamzah
reading wa iyyáka, just as it was the case with the French
<span lang="fr">Le héros</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the conjunctive Hamzah is preceded by a quiescent letter,
this takes generally Kasrah: “Tálat al-Laylah,” the night was
longsome, would become Tálati ’l-Laylah. If, however, the
quiescent letter is one of prolongation, it mostly drops out
altogether, and the Harakah of the next preceding letter becomes
the connecting vowel between the two words, which in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>parlance would mean, that the end-vowel of the first word is
shortened before the elided initial of the second. Thus “fí
al-bayti,” in the house, which in Arabic is written f(i)y h(a)lb(a)yt(i)
and which we transliterate fí ’l-bayti, is in poetry read
fil-bayti, where we must remember, that the syllable fil, in spite
of its short vowel, represents a long quantity, because it consists
of a moved letter followed by a quiescent one. Fíl would be overlong
and could, according to Arabic prosody, stand only in certain
cases at the end of a verse, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> in pause, where a natural tendency
prevails to prolong a sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attentive reader will now be able to fix the prosodical value
of the line quoted above with unerring security. For metrical
purposes it syllabifies into: A-ká-mul-vaj-da fí kal-bí wa sá-rú,
containing three short and eight long quantities. The initial
unaccented a is short, for the same reason why the syllables
da and wa are so, that is, because it corresponds to an Arabic
letter, the Hamzah or silent h, moved by Fathah. The syllables
ká, fí, bí, sá, rú, are long for the same reason, why the syllables
mul, waj, kal are so, that is, because the accent in the transliteration
corresponds to a quiescent Arabic letter, following a
moved one. The same simple criterion applies to the whole
list, in which I give in alphabetical order the first lines and the
metre of all the poetical pieces contained in the Mac. edition, and
which will be found at the end of this volume.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prosodical unities, then, in Arabic are the moved and the
quiescent letter, and we are now going to show how they combine
into metrical elements, feet, and metres.</p>

<p class='c000'>i. The metrical elements (Usúl) are:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The Sabab,<a id='r450' href='#f450' class='c016'><sup>[450]</sup></a> which consists of <em>two</em> letters and is either
khafíf (light) or sakíl (heavy). A moved letter followed by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>quiescent, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> a closed syllable, like the aforementioned taf,
lun, mus, to which we may now add fá = fah, ’í = ’iy, ’ú = ’uw,
form a Sabab khafíf, corresponding to the classical long quantity
(<span class='meter'>‑</span>). Two moved letters in succession, like muta, ’ala, constitute
a Sabab sakíl, for which the classical name would be Pyrrhic
(<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑</span>). As in Latin and Greek, they are equal in weight and
can frequently interchange, that is to say, the Sabab khafíf
can be evolved into a sakíl by moving its second Harf, or the
latter contracted into the former, by making its second letter
quiescent.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The Watad, consisting of <em>three</em> letters, one of which is
quiescent. If the quiescent follows the two moved ones, the
Watad is called majmú’ (collected or joined), as fa’ú (= fa’uw),
mafá (= mafah), ’ilun, and it corresponds to the classical Iambus
(<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑</span>). If, on the contrary, the quiescent intervenes or separates
between the two moved letters, as in fá’i (= fah’i), látu (= lahtu),
taf’i, the Watad is called mafrúk (separated), and has its classical
equivalent in the Trochee (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The Fásilah,<a id='r451' href='#f451' class='c016'><sup>[451]</sup></a> containing <em>four</em> letters, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> three moved ones
followed by a quiescent, and which, in fact, is only a shorter name
for a Sabab sakíl followed by a Sabab khafíf, as muta + fá, or
’ala + tun, both of the measure of the classical Anapaest
(<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>ii. These three elements, the Sabab, Watad and Fásilah, combine
further into feet Arkán, pl. of Rukn, or Ajzá, pl. of Juz,
two words explained supra p. <a href='#Page_275'>275</a>. The technical terms by
which the feet are named, are derivatives of the root fa’l, to
do, which as the student will remember, serves in Arabic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Grammar to form the Auzán or weights, in accordance with
which words are derived from roots. It consists of the three
letters Fá (f), ’Ayn (’), Lám (l), and, like any other Arabic
root, cannot strictly speaking be pronounced, for the introduction
of any vowel-sound would make it cease to be a root and change
it into an individual word. The above fa’l, for instance, where the
initial Fá is moved by Fathah (a), is the Infinitive or verbal noun,
“to do,” “doing.” If the ’Ayn also is moved by Fathah, we
obtain fa’al, meaning in colloquial Arabic “he did” (the classical
or literary form would be fa’ala). Pronouncing the first letter
with Zammah (u), the second with Kasrah (i), <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, fu’il, we say
“it was done” (classically fu’ila). Many more forms are derived
by prefixing, inserting or subjoining certain additional letters
called Hurúf al-Ziyádah (letters of increase) to the original
radicals: fá’il, for instance, with an Alif of prolongation in the
first syllable, means “doer;” maf’úl (= maf’uwl), where the
quiescent Fá is preceded by a fathated Mím (m), and the zammated
’Ayn followed by a lengthening Waw, means “done”;
Mufá’alah, where in addition to a prefixed and inserted letter, the
feminine termination ah is subjoined after the Lám means “to do
a thing reciprocally.” Since these and similar changes are with
unvarying regularity applicable to all roots, the grammarians use
the derivatives of Fa’l as model-forms for the corresponding derivations
of any other root, whose letters are in this case called its
Fá, ’Ayn and Lám. From a root, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, which has Káf (k) for its
first letter or Fá, Tá (t) for its second letter or ’Ayn, and Bá (b)
for its third letter or Lám</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>fa’l would be katb = to write, writing;</div>
      <div class='line'>fa’al would be katab = he wrote;</div>
      <div class='line'>fu’il would be kutib = it was written;</div>
      <div class='line'>fá’il would be kátib = writer, scribe;</div>
      <div class='line'>maf’úl would be maktúb = written, letter;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>mufá’alah would be mukátabah = to write reciprocally, correspondence.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The advantage of this system is evident. It enables the student,
who has once grasped the original meaning of a root, to form
scores of words himself, and in his readings, to understand
hundreds, nay thousands, of words, without recourse to the
Dictionary, as soon as he has learned to distinguish their radical
letters from the letters of increase, and recognises in them a
familiar root. We cannot wonder, therefore, that the inventor of
Arabic Prosody, readily availed himself of the same plan for his
own ends. The Taf’íl, as it is here called, that is the representation
of the metrical feet by current derivatives of fa’l, has in this
case, of course, nothing to do with the etymological meaning of
those typical forms. But it proves none the less useful in another
direction: in simply naming a particular foot it shows at the same
time its prosodical measure and character, as will now be explained
in detail.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen supra p. <a href='#Page_275'>275</a> that the word Akámú consists of a
short syllable followed by two long ones (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), and consequently
forms a foot, which the classics would call Bacchíus. In Latin
there is no connection between this name and the metrical value
of the foot: we must learn both by heart. But if we are told
that its Taf’íl in Arabic is Fa’úlun, we understand at once that it
is composed of the Watad majmú’ fa’ú (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑</span>) and the Sabab
khafíf lun (<span class='meter'>‑</span>), and as the Watad contains three, the Sabab
two letters, it forms a quinqueliteral foot or Juz khamásí.</p>

<p class='c000'>In combining into feet, the Watad has the precedence over the
Sabab and the Fásilah, and again the Watad majmú’ over the
Watad mafrúk. Hence the Prosodists distinguish between Ajzá
aslíyah or primary feet (from Asl, root), in which this precedence is
observed, and Ájzá far’íyah or secondary feet (from Far’ = branch),
in which it is reversed. The former are four in number:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>1. Fa’ú.lun, consisting, as we have just seen of a Watad majmú’
followed by a Sabab khafíf, = the Latin Bacchíus (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Mafá.’í.lun, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Watad majmú’ followed by two Sabab khafíf
= the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus primus</span> (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Mufá.’alatun, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Watad majmú’ followed by Fásilah = the
Latin Iambus followed by Anapaest (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Fá’i.lá.tun, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Watad mafrúk followed by two Sabab khafíf
= the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus secundus</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of the secondary feet increases to six, for as No. 2
and 4 contain two Sabab, they “branch out” into two derived
feet each, according to both Sabab or only one changing place
with regard to the Watad. They are:</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Fá.’ilun, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Sabab khafíf followed by Watad majmú’, =
the Latin <span lang="la">Creticus</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>). The primary Fa’ú.lun becomes by
transposition Lun.fa’ú. To bring this into conformity with a
current derivative of fa’l, the initial Sabab must be made to contain
the first letter of the root, and the Watad the two remaining
ones in their proper order. Fá is therefore substituted for lun,
and ’ilun for fa’ú, forming together the above Fá.’ilun. By similar
substitutions, which it would be tedious to specify in each separate
case, Mafá.’í.lun becomes:</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Mus.taf.’ilun, for ’Í.lun.mafá, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> two Sabab khafíf, followed
by Watad majmú’ = the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus tertius</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), or:</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Fá.’ilá.tun, for Lun.mafá.’í, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Watad majmú’ between two
Sabab khafíf = the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus secundus</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Mutafá.’ilun (for ’Alatun.mufá, the reversed Mufá.’alatun)
<i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Fásilah followed by Watad majmú’ = the Latin Anapaest
succeeded by Iambus (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>). The last two secondary feet
are transpositions of No. 4, Fá’.i lá.tun, namely:</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Maf.’ú.látu, for Lá.tun.fá’i, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> two Sabab khafíf, followed
by Watad mafrúk = the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus quartus</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>10. Mus.taf’i.lun, for Tun.fá’i.lá, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Watad mafrúk between
two Sabab khafíf = the Latin <span lang="la">Epitritus tertius</span> (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>).<a id='r452' href='#f452' class='c016'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The “branch”-foot Fá.’ilun (No. 5), like its “root” Fa’úlun
(No. 1), is quinqueliteral. All other feet, primary or secondary,
consist necessarily of seven letters, as they contain a triliteral
Watad (see supra i. 2) with either two biliteral Sabab khafíf (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_1">1</a>,)
or a quadriliteral Fásilah (i. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51252/51252-h/51252-h.htm#Page_3">3</a>). They are, therefore, called
Sabá’í = seven lettered.</p>

<p class='c000'>iii. The same principle of the Watad taking precedence over
Sabab and Fásilah, rules the arrangement of the Arabic metres,
which are divided into five circles (Dawáir, pl. of Dáirah) so called
for reasons presently to be explained. The first is named:</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Dáirat al-Mukhtalif, circle of “the varied” metre, because
it is composed of feet of various length, the five-lettered Fa’úlun
(supra ii. 1) and the seven-lettered Mafá’ílun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_2">2</a>) with their
secondaries Fá’ilun, Mustaf.’ilun and Fá.’ilátun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_5">5</a>–7), and it comprises
three Buhúr or metres (pl. of Bahr, sea), the Tawíl, Madíd
and Basít.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Al-Tawíl, consisting of twice</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fa’ú.lun Mafá.’ílun Fa’ú.lun Mafá.’ílun,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If we transfer the Watad Fa’ú from the beginning of the line to
the end, it would read:</p>

<p class='c000'>Lun.mafá’í Lun.fa’ú Lun.mafá’í Lun.fa’ú which, after the substitutions
indicated above (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_7">7</a> and 5) becomes:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>2. Al-Madíd, consisting of twice</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If again, returning to the Tawíl, we make the break after the
Watad of the second foot we obtain the line:</p>

<p class='c000'>’Ílun.fa’ú Lun.mafá ’Ílun.fa’u Lun.mafá, and as metrically
’Ílun.fa’ú (two Sabab followed by Watad) and Lun.mafá (one
Sabab followed by Watad) are = ’Ílun.mafá and Lun.fa’ú respectively,
their Taf’il is effected by the same substitutions as in
ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_5">5</a> and 6, and they become:</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Basít, consisting of twice</p>

    <div class='group'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus one metre evolves from another by a kind of rotation,
which suggested to the Prosodists an ingenious device of representing
them by circles (hence the name Dáirah), round the circumference
of which on the outside the complete Taf’íl of the
original metre is written, while each moved letter is faced by a
small loop, each quiescent by a small vertical stroke<a id='r453' href='#f453' class='c016'><sup>[453]</sup></a> inside the
circle. Then, in the case of this present Dáirat al-Mukhtalif for
instance, the loop corresponding to the initial f of the first Fa’úlun
is marked as the beginning of the Tawíl, that corresponding to
its l (of the Sabab lun) as the beginning of the Madid, and that
corresponding to the ’Ayn of the next Mafá’ílun as the beginning
of the Basít. The same process applies to all the following circles,
but our limited space compels us simply to enumerate them,
together with their Buhúr, without further reference to the mode
of their evolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The feet and metres as given above, are however to a certain
extent merely theoretical; in practice the former admit of
numerous licenses and the latter of variations brought about by
modification or partial suppression of the feet final in a verse.
An Arabic poem (Kasídah, or if numbering less than ten couplets,
Kat’ah) consists of Bayts or couplets, bound together by a
continuous rhyme, which connects the first two lines and is
repeated at the end of every second line throughout the poem.
The <em>last</em> foot of every odd line is called ’Arúz (fem. in contradistinction
of Arúz in the sense of Prosody which is masc.) pl.
A’áiriz, that of every even line is called Zarb, pl. Azrub, and the
remaining feet may be termed Hashw (stuffing), although in
stricter parlance a further distinction is made between the <em>first</em>
foot of every odd and even line as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now with regard to the Hashw on the one hand, and the ’Aruz
and Zarb on the other, the changes which the normal feet undergo,
are of two kinds: Zuháf (deviation) and ’Illah (defect). Zuháf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>applies, as a rule, occasionally and optionally to the second
letter of a Sabab in those feet which compose the Hashw or body-part
of a verse, making a long syllable short by suppressing its
quiescent final, or contracting two short quantities in a long one,
by rendering quiescent a moved letter which stands second in
a Sabab sakíl. In Mustaf’ilun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_6">6</a>. = <span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), for instance,
the s of the first syllable, or the f of the second, or both may be
dropped and it will become accordingly Mutaf’ilun, by substitution
Mafá’ilun, (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>) or Musta’ilun, by substitution, Mufta’ilun
(<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), or Muta’ilun, by substitution Fa’ilatun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>).<a id='r454' href='#f454' class='c016'><sup>[454]</sup></a> This
means that wherever the foot Mustaf.’ilun occurs in the Hashw of
a poem, we can represent it by the scheme <span class='meter'>⏓&nbsp;⏓&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span> <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the Epitritus
tertius can, by poetical license change into Diiambus, Choriambus
or <span lang="la">Paeon quartus</span>. In Mufá’alatun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_3">3</a>. = <span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>) and Mutafá’ilun
(ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_8">8</a>. = <span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), again, the Sabab ’ala and muta may become
khafíf by suppression of their final Harakah and thus turn into
Mufá’altun, by substitution Mafá’ílun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_2">2</a>. = <span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), and
Mutfá’ilun, by substitution Mustaf’ilun (ii. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51775/51775-h/51775-h.htm#Page_6">6</a>. = <span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span> as above).
In other words the two feet correspond to the schemes <span class='meter'>⏑</span> _ <span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span> _ and
<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span> _ <span class='meter'>⏑</span> _, where a Spondee can take the place of the Anapaest after
or before the Iambus respectively.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Illah, the second way of modifying the primitive or normal feet,
applies to both Sabab and Watad, but only in the ’Aruz and
Zarb of a couplet, being at the same time constant and obligatory.
Besides the changes already mentioned, it consists in adding one
or two letters to a Sabab or Watad, or curtailing them more or
less, even to cutting them off altogether. We cannot here exhaust
this matter any more than those touched upon until now, but
must be satisfied with an example or two, to show the proceeding
in general and indicate its object.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>We have seen that the metre Basít consists of the two lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mustaf.’ilun Fá.’ilun Mustaf’ilun Fá’ilun</div>
      <div class='line'>Mustaf’ilun Fá’ilun Mustaf’ilun Fá’ilun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This complete form, however, is not in use amongst Arab
poets. If by the Zuháf Khabn, here acting as ’Illah, the Alif in
the final Fá’ilun is suppressed, changing it into Fa’ilun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), it
becomes the first ’Aruz, called makhbúnah, of the Basít, the
first Zarb of which is obtained by submitting the final Fá’ilun of
the second line to the same process. A second Zarb results, if in
Fá’ilun the final n of the Watad ’ilun is <em>cut</em> off and the preceding l
made quiescent by the ’Illah Kat’ thus giving Fá’il and by substitution
Fa’lun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑</span>). Thus the formula becomes:—</p>

<table class="table1">
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>Mustaf’ilun Fá’ilun Mustaf’ilun</td>

<p class='c000'>As in the Hashw, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the first three feet of each line, the Khabn
can likewise be applied to the medial Fá’ilun, and for Mustaf’ilun
the poetical licenses, explained above, may be introduced, this
first ’Arúz or Class of the Basít with its two Zarb or subdivisions

<p class='c000'>that is to say in the first subdivision of this form of the Basít
both lines of each couplet end with an Anapaest and every second
line of the other subdivision terminates in a Spondee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Basít has four more A’áriz, three called majzúah, because
each line is shortened by a Juz or foot, one called mashtúrah
(halved), because the number of feet is reduced from four to two,
and we may here notice that the former kind of lessening the
number of feet is frequent with the hexametrical circles (B. C. D.),
while the latter kind can naturally only occur in those
circles, whose couplet forms an octameter (A. E.). Besides being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>majzúah, the second ’Aruz is sahíhah (perfect) consisting of the
normal foot Mustaf’ilun. It has three Azrub: 1. Mustaf’ilán
(<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>, with an overlong final syllable, see supra p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>),
produced by the ’Illah Tazyíl, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> addition of a quiescent letter at
the end (Mustaf’ilunn, by substitution Mustaf’ilán); 2. Mustaf’ilun,
like the ’Aruz; 3. Maf’úlun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), produced by the ’Illah Kat’
(see the preceding page; Mustaf’ilun, by dropping the final n and
making the l quiescent becomes Mustaf’il and by substitution
Maf’úlun). Hence the formula is:</p>

<p class='c000'>The above will suffice to illustrate the general method of the
Prosodists, and we must refer the reader for the remaining classes
and subdivisions of the Basít as well as the other metres to more
special treatises on the subject, to which this Essay is intended
merely as an introduction, with a view to facilitate the first steps
of the student in an important, but I fear somewhat neglected
field of Arabic learning.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we now turn to the poetical pieces contained in The Nights,
we find that out of the fifteen metres, known to al-Khalíl, or the
sixteen of later Prosodists, instances of thirteen occur in the
Mac. N. edition, but in vastly different proportions. The total
number amounts to 1,385 pieces (some, however, repeated several
times), out of which 1,128 belong to the first two circles, leaving
only 257 for the remaining three. The same disproportionality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>obtains with regard to the metres of each circle. The Mukhtalif
is represented by 331 instances of Tawíl and 330 of Basít against
3 of Madíd; the Mutalif by 321 instances of Kámil against 143
of Wáfir; the Mujtalab by 32 instances of Ramal and 30 of Rajaz
against 1 of Hazaj; the Mushtabih by 72 instances of Khafíf and
52 of Sarí’ against 18 of Munsarih and 15 of Mujtass; and lastly
the Muttafik by 37 instances of Mutakárib. Neither the Mutadárak
(E. 2), nor the Muzári’ and Muktazib (D. 4. 5) are met
with.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally it remains for me to quote a couplet of each metre,
showing how to scan them, and what relation they bear to the
theoretical formulas exhibited on p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a> to p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is characteristic for the preponderance of the Tawíl over all
the other metres, that the first four lines, with which my alphabetical
list begins, are written in it. One of these belongs to a
poem which has for its author Bahá al-Dín Zuhayr (born A.D. 1186
at Mekkah or in its vicinity, ob. 1249 at Cairo), and is to be
found in full in Professor Palmer’s edition of his works, p. <a href='#Page_164'>164</a>.

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>In referring to iii. A. <span class='fss'>I</span>. p. 282, it will be seen that in the Hashw
Fa’úlun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>) has become Fa’úlu (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span>) by a Zuháf called
Kabz (suppression of the fifth letter of a foot if it is quiescent),
and that in the ’Arúz and Zarb Mafá’ílun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>) has changed
into Mafá’ilun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>) by the same Zuháf acting as ’Illah.
The latter alteration shows the couplet to be of the second Zarb
of the first ’Arúz of the Tawíl. If the second line did terminate
in Mafá’ílun, as in the original scheme, it would be the first Zarb of
the same ’Arúz; if it did end in Fa’úlun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>) or Mafá’íl (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>)
it would represent the third or fourth subdivision of this first class
respectively. The Tawíl has one other ’Arúz, Fa’úlun, with a
twofold Zarb, either Fa’úlun also, or Mafá’ilun.</p>

<p class='c000'>As an example of the Madíd we quote the original of the lines

<p class='c000'>If we compare this with the formula (iii. A. 2 p. 283), we find that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>either line of the couplet is shortened by a foot; it is, therefore,
majzú. The first ’Arúz of this abbreviated metre is Fá’ilátun
(<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), and is called sahíhah (perfect) because it consists of
the normal third foot. In the second ’Arúz Fá’ilátun loses its
end syllable tun by the ’Illah Hafz (suppression of a final Sabab
khafíf), and becomes Fá’ilá (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>), for which Fá’ilun is substituted.
Shortening the first syllable of Fá’ilun, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> eliminating
the Alif by Khabn, we obtain the third ’Arúz Fa’ilun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑</span>)
as that of the present lines, which has two Azrub: Fa’ilun, like
the ’Arúz, and Fa’lun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑</span>), here, again by Khabn, further
reduced to Fa’al (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;‑</span>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Ishak of Mosul, who improvises the piece, calls it “so difficult
and so rare, that it went nigh to deaden the quick and to quicken
the dead;” indeed, the native poets consider the metre Madíd as
the most difficult of all, and it is scarcely ever attempted by later
writers. This accounts for its rare occurrence in The Nights,
where only two more instances are to be found, Mac. N. ii. 244
and iii. 404.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second and third circle will best be spoken of together, as
the Wáfir and Kámil have a natural affinity to the Hazaj and
Rajaz. Let us revert to the line:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Translated, as it were, into the language of the Prosodists it will

<p class='c000'>and this, standing by itself, might <span lang="la">prima facie</span> be taken for a line
of the Hazaj (iii. C. 1), with the third Mafá’ílun shortened by

<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>We have seen (p. <a href='#Page_287'>287</a>) that and how the foot Mufá’alatun

even in one foot only along with the latter, it is considered to be
the original measure, and the poem counts no longer as Hazaj
but as Wáfir. In the piece now under consideration, it is the
second Bayt where the characteristic foot of the Wáfir first

<p class='c000'>It must, however, be remarked that the Hazaj is not in use as a
hexameter, but only with an ’Arúz majzúah or shortened by one

<p class='c000'>The ’Arúz of the first couplet is Mutafá’ilun, assigning the piece
to the first or perfect (sahíhah) class of the Kámil. In the Hashw
of the opening line and in that of the whole second Bayt this
normal Mutafá’ilun has, by license, become Mustaf’ilun, and the
same change has taken place in the ’Arúz of the second couplet;
for it is a peculiarity which this metre shares with a few others, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>allow certain alterations of the kind Zuháf in the ’Arúz and Zarb
as well as in the Hashw. This class has three subdivisions: the
Zarb of the first is Mutafá’ilun, like the ’Arúz; the Zarb of the
second is Fa’alátun (<span class='meter'>⏑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>), a substitution for Mutafá’il which
latter is obtained from Mutafá’ilun by suppressing the final <em>n</em> and
rendering the <em>l</em> quiescent; the Zarb of the third is Fa’lun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑</span>)
for Mútfá, derived from Mutafá’ilun by cutting off the Watad ’ilun
and dropping the medial <em>a</em> of the remaining Mutafá.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we make the ’Ayn of the second Zarb Fa’alátun also quiescent
by the permitted Zuháf Izmár, it changes into Fa’látun, by
substitution Maf’úlun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>) which terminates the rhyming lines
of the foregoing quotation. Consequently the two couplets taken
together, belong to the second Zarb of the first ’Arúz of the
Kámil, and the metre of the poem with its licenses may be represented
by the scheme:</p>

<p class='c000'>with a different rhyme and of a different variation of metre.
The amputated piece belongs to the fourth Zarb of the third
’Aruz of Kámil, and its second couplet tallies with the second subdivision
of the second class of Rajaz.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajaz, a iambic metre pure and simple, is the most popular,
because the easiest, in which even the Prophet was caught napping
sometimes, at the dangerous risk of following the perilous leadership
of Imru ’l-Kays. It is the metre of improvisation, of ditties,
and of numerous didactic poems. In the latter case, when the
composition is called Urjúzah, the two lines of every Bayt rhyme,
and each Bayt has a rhyme of its own. This is the form in which
for instance, Ibn Málik’s Alfíyah is written, as well as the remarkable
grammatical work of the modern native scholar, Nasíf al-Yazijí,
of which a notice will be found in Chenery’s Introduction
to his Translation of Al-Hariri.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the Hazaj and Rajaz connect the third circle with the
first and second, the Ramal forms the link between the third and
fourth Dáirah. Its measure Fá’ilátun (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;⏑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑</span>) and the reversal
of it, Maf’úlátu (<span class='meter'>‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;‑&nbsp;⏑</span>), affect the trochaic rhythm, as opposed
to the iambic of the two first-named metres. The iambic movement
has a ring of gladness about it, the trochaic a wail of sadness:
the former resembles a nimble pedestrian, striding apace
with an elastic step and a cheerful heart; the latter is like a man
toiling along on the desert path, where his foot is ever and anon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>sliding back in the burning sand (Raml, whence probably the
name of the metre). Both combined in regular alternation, impart
an agitated character to the verse, admirably fit to express
the conflicting emotions of a passion-stirred mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Examples of these more or less plaintive and pathetic metres
are numerous in the Tale of Uns al-Wujúd and the Wazir’s
Daughter, which, being throughout a story of love, as has been
noted, vol. v. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54257/54257-h/54257-h.htm#Page_33">33</a>, abounds in verse, and, in particular, contains

<p class='c000'>As an instance of the Munsarih, I give the second occurring
in The Nights, because it affords me an opportunity to show the
student how useful a knowledge of the laws of Prosody frequently
proves for ascertaining the correct reading of a text. Mac. N. i.
33 we find the line:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>This would be Rajaz with the license Mufta’ilun for Mustaf’ilun.
But the following lines of the fragment evince, that the metre is
Munsarih; hence, a clerical error must lurk somewhere in the second
foot. In fact, on page 833 of the same volume, we find the
piece repeated, and here the first couplet reads</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mutakárib, the last of the metres employed in The Nights,
has gained a truly historical importance by the part which it plays
in Persian literature. In the form of trimetrical double-lines, with
a several rhyme for each couplet, it has become the “Nibelungen-”
stanza of the Persian epos: Firdausí’s immortal “Book of Kings”
and Nizámi’s Iskander-námah are written in it, not to mention a
host of Masnawis in which Sufic mysticism combats Mohammedan
orthodoxy. On account of its warlike and heroical character,
therefore, I choose for an example the knightly Jamrakán’s challenge
to the single fight in which he conquers his scarcely less
valiant adversary Kaurajan, Mac. N. iii. 296:</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the third syllable of the second foot in each line is shortened
by license, and the final Kasrah of the first line, standing in
pause, is long, the metre being the full form of the Mutakárib
as exhibited p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>, iii. E. i. If we suppress the Kasrah of
al-Janáni, which is also allowable in pause, and make the second
line to rhyme with the first, saying, for instance:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>we obtain the powerful and melodious metre in which the Sháhnámah
sings of Rustam’s lofty deeds, of the tender love of Rúdabah
and the tragic downfall of Siyawush.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shall I confess that in writing the foregoing pages it has been
my ambition to become a conqueror, in a modest way, myself: to
conquer, I mean, the prejudice frequently entertained, and shared
even by my accomplished countryman, Rückert, that Arabic Prosody
is a clumsy and repulsive doctrine. I have tried to show
that it springs naturally from the character of the language, and,
intimately connected, as it is, with the grammatical system of the
Arabs, it appears to me quite worthy of the acumen of a people,
to whom, amongst other things, we owe the invention of Algebra,
the stepping-stone of our whole modern system of Mathematics.
I cannot refrain, therefore, from concluding with a little anecdote
anent al-Khalíl, which Ibn Khallikán tells in the following words.
His son went one day into the room where his father was, and on
finding him scanning a piece of poetry by the rules of prosody,
he ran out and told the people that his father had lost his wits.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>They went in immediately and related to al-Khalíl what they had
heard, on which he addressed his son in these terms:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Had you known what I was saying, you would have excused
me, and had you known what you said, I should have blamed you.
But you did not understand me, so you blamed me, and I knew
that you were ignorant, so I pardoned you.”</p>

<h5 class='c019'>L’Envoi.</h5>

<p class='c018'>Here end, to my sorrow, the labours of a quarter-century and
here I must perforce say with the “poets’ Poet,”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Behold! I see the haven nigh at hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>To which I mean my wearie course to bend;</div>
      <div class='line'>Vere the main shete, and bear up with the land</div>
      <div class='line'>The which afore is fairly to be ken’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nothing of importance now indeed remains for me but briefly
to estimate the character of my work and to take cordial leave of
my readers, thanking them for the interest they have accorded to
these volumes and for enabling me thus successfully to complete
the decade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without pudor malus or over-diffidence I would claim to have
fulfilled the promise contained in my Foreword. The anthropological
notes and notelets, which not only illustrate and read
between the lines of the text, but assist the student of Moslem
life and of Arabo-Egyptian manners, customs and language in
a multitude of matters shunned by books, form a repertory of
Eastern knowledge in its esoteric phase, sexual as well as
social.</p>

<p class='c000'>To assert that such lore is unnecessary is to state, as every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>traveller knows, an “absurdum.” Few phenomena are more
startling than the vision of a venerable infant, who has lived
half his long life in the midst of the wildest anthropological
vagaries and monstrosities, and yet who absolutely ignores all
that India or Burmah enacts under his very eyes. This is crass
ignorance, not the naive innocence of Saint Francis who, seeing
a man and a maid in a dark corner, raised his hands to Heaven
and thanked the Lord that there was still in the world so much
of Christian Charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against such lack of knowledge my notes are a protest; and
I may claim success despite the difficulty of the task. A traveller
familiar with Syria and Palestine, Herr Landberg, writes, “<span lang="fr">La
plume refuserait son service, la langue serait insuffisante, si celui
qui connaît la vie de tous les jours des Orientaux, surtout des
classes élevées, voulait la devoiler. L’Europe est bien loin d’en
avoir la moindre idée</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In this matter I have done my best, at a time too when the
hapless English traveller is expected to write like a young lady
for young ladies, and never to notice what underlies the most
superficial stratum. And I also maintain that the free treatment
of topics usually taboo’d and held to be “alekta”—unknown
and unfitted for publicity—will be a national benefit to an
“Empire of Opinion,” whose very basis and buttresses are a
thorough knowledge by the rulers of the ruled. Men have been
crowned with gold in the Capitol for lesser services rendered to
the Respublica.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the work contains errors, shortcomings and many a lapsus,
I am the first and foremost to declare. Yet in justice to myself
I must also notice that the maculæ are few and far between; even
the most unfriendly and interested critics have failed to point
out an abnormal number of slips. And before pronouncing the
“<span lang="la">Vos plaudite!</span>” or, as Easterns more politely say, “I implore
that my poor name may be raised aloft on the tongue of praise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>let me invoke the fair field and courteous favour which the
Persian poet expected from his readers.</p>

<p class='c015'>I make no apology for the number and extent of bibliographical
and other lists given in this Appendix: they may cumber the
book but they are necessary to complete my design. This has
been to supply throughout the ten volumes the young Arabist
and student of Orientalism and Anthropology with such assistance
as I can render him; and it is my conviction that if with the
aid of this version he will master the original text of the
“Thousand Nights and a Night,” he will find himself at home
amongst educated men in Egypt and Syria, Najd and Mesopotamia
and be able to converse with them like a gentleman; not, as
too often happens in Anglo-India, like a “Ghoráwálá” (groom).
With this object he will learn by heart what instinct and inclination
suggest of the proverbs and instances, the verses, the <span lang="fr">jeux
d’esprit</span> and especially the Koranic citations scattered about the
text; and my indices will enable him to hunt up the tale or the
verses which he may require for quotation even when writing an
ordinary letter to a “native” correspondent. Thus he will be
spared the wasted labour of wading through volumes in order to
pick up a line.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS, AND THEIR IMITATIONS, WITH A TABLE SHOWING THE CONTENTS OF THE PRINCIPAL EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS OF THE NIGHTS.</em></h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> W. F. KIRBY,</div>
    <div class='c001'>Author of “Ed-Dimiryaht: an Oriental Romance,” “The New Arabian Nights,” &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The European editions of the Thousand and One Nights, even excluding the
hundreds of popular editions which have nothing specially noticeable about
them, are very numerous; and the following Notes must, I am fully aware, be
incomplete, though they will, perhaps, be found useful to persons interested in
the subject. Although I believe that editions of most of the English, French,
and German versions of any importance have passed through my hands, I have
not had an opportunity of comparing many in other languages, some of which
at least may be independent editions, not derived from Galland. The imitations
and adaptations of The Nights are, perhaps, more numerous than the
editions of The Nights themselves, if we exclude mere reprints of Galland; and
many of them are even more difficult of access.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following Notes, I have sometimes referred to tales by their numbers
in the Table.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>GALLAND’S MS. AND TRANSLATION.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>The first MS. of The Nights known in Europe was brought to Paris by
Galland at the close of the 17th century; and his translation was published
in Paris, in twelve small volumes, under the title of “<span lang="fr">Les Mille et une
Nuit: Contes Arabes, traduits en Francois par M. Galland</span>.” These volumes
appeared at intervals between 1704 and 1717. Galland himself died in 1715,
and it is uncertain how far he was responsible for the latter part of the work.
Only the first six of the twelve vols. are divided into Nights, vol. 6 completing
the story of Camaralzaman, and ending with Night 234. The Voyages of
Sindbad are not found in Galland’s MS., though he has intercalated them as
Nights 69–90 between Nos. 3 and 4. It should be mentioned, however, that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>some texts (Bresl., for instance) No. 133 is placed much earlier in the series than
in others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stories in Galland’s last six vols. may be divided into two classes, viz.,
those known to occur in genuine texts of The Nights, and those which do not.
To the first category belong Nos. 7, 8, 59, 153 and 170; and some even of these
are not found in Galland’s own MS., but were derived by him from other sources.
The remaining tales (Nos. 191–198) do not really belong to The Nights; and,
strange to say, although they are certainly genuine Oriental tales, the actual
originals have never been found. I am inclined to think that Galland may,
perhaps, have written and adapted them from his recollection of stories which
he himself heard related during his own residence in the East, especially as
most of these tales appear to be derived rather from Persian or Turkish than
from Arabian sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following Preface appeared in vol. 9 which I translate from Talander’s
German edition, as the original is not before me:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The two stories with which the eighth volume concludes do not properly
belong to the Thousand and One Nights. They were added and printed without
the previous knowledge of the translator, who had not the slightest idea of
the trick that had been played upon him until the eighth volume was actually
on sale. The reader must not, therefore, be surprised that the story of the
Sleeper Awakened, which commences vol. 9, is written as if Scheherazade had
related it immediately after the story of Ganem, which forms the greater part of
vol. 8. Care will be taken to omit these two stories in a new edition, as not
belonging to the work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at that when the new edition was actually
published, subsequently to Galland’s death, the condemned stories were retained,
and the preface withdrawn; though No. 170 still reads as if it followed No. 8.</p>

<p class='c000'>The information I have been able to collect respecting the disputed tales is
very slight. I once saw a MS. advertised in an auction catalogue (I think that
of the library of the late Prof. H. H. Wilson) as containing two of Galland’s
doubtful tales, but which they were was not stated. The fourth and last volume
of the MS. used by Galland is lost; but it is almost certain that it did not
contain any of these tales (compare Payne, ix. 265 note).</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of Zeyn Alasnam (No. 191) is derived from the same source as
that of the Fourth Durwesh, in the well-known Hindustani reading-book, the
Bagh o Bahar. If it is based upon this, Galland has greatly altered and improved
it, and has given it the whole colouring of a European moral fairy tale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of Ali Baba (No. 195) is, I have been told, a Chinese tale. It
occurs under the title of the Two Brothers and the Forty-nine Dragons in
Geldart’s Modern Greek Tales. It has also been stated that the late Prof.
Palmer met with a very similar story among the Arabs of Sinai (Payne, ix. 266).</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of Sidi Nouman (No. 194b) may have been based partly upon the
Third Shaykh’s Story (No. 1c), which Galland omits. The feast of the Ghools
is, I believe, Greek or Turkish, rather than Arabic, in character, as vampires,
personified plague, and similar horrors are much commoner in the folk-lore of
the former peoples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many incidents of the doubtful, as well as of the genuine tales, are common
in European folk-lore (versions of Nos. 2 and 198, for instance, occur in Grimm’s
Kinder und Hausmärchen), and some of the doubtful tales have their analogues
in Scott’s MS., as will be noticed in due course.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>I have not seen Galland’s original edition in 12 vols.; but the Stadt-Bibliothek
of Frankfort-on-Main contains a copy, published at La Haye, in 12
vols. (with frontispieces), made up of two or more editions, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. i. (ed. 6) 1729; vols. ii. iii. iv. (ed. 5) 1729; vols. v. vi. viii. (ed. 5)
1728; vol. vii. (ed. 6) 1731; vols. ix. to xi. (ed. not noted) 1730; and vol. xii.
(ed. not noted) 1731.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discrepancies in the dates of the various volumes looks (as Mr. Clouston
has suggested) as if separate volumes were reprinted as required, independently
of the others. This might account for vols. v. vi. and viii. of the fifth edition
having been apparently reprinted before vols. ii. iii. and iv.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest French version in the British Museum consists of the first eight
vols., published at La Haye, and likewise made up of different editions, as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>i. (ed. 5) 1714; ii. iii. iv. (ed. 4) 1714; v. vi. (ed. 5) 1728; vii. (ed. 5) 1719;
viii. (“<span lang="fr">suivant la copie imprimée à Paris</span>”) 1714.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most French editions (old and new) contain Galland’s Dedication, “<span lang="fr">À
Madame Madame la Marquise d’O., Dame du Palais de Madame la Duchesse
de Bourgogne</span>,” followed by an “<span lang="fr">Avertissement</span>.” In addition to these, the
La Haye copies have Fontenelle’s Approbation prefixed to several volumes, but
in slightly different words, and bearing different dates. December 27th, 1703
(vol. i.); April 14th, 1704 (vol. vi.); and October 4th, 1705 (vol. vii.). This is
according to the British Museum copy; I did not examine the Frankfort copy
with reference to the Approbation. The Approbation is translated in full in the
old English version as follows: “I have read, by Order of my Lord Chancellor,
this Manuscript, wherein I find nothing that ought to hinder its being Printed.
And I am of opinion that the Publick will be very well pleased with the Perusal
of these Oriental Stories. Paris, 27th December, 1705 [apparently a misprint
for 1703] (Signed) <span class='sc'>Fontenelle</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Paris edition of 1726 (vide infrà), Galland says in his Dedication,
“<span lang="fr">Il a fallu le faire venir de Syrie, et mettre en François, le premier volume que
voici, de quatre seulement qui m’ont été envoyez</span>.” So, also, in a Paris edition
(in eight vols. 12mo) of 1832; but in the La Haye issue of 1714, we read not
“quatre” but “six” volumes. The old German edition of Talander (vide infrà)
does not contain Galland’s Dedication (Epitre) or Avertissement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The earliest French editions were generally in 12 vols., or six; I possess a
copy of a six-volume edition, published at Paris in 1726. It may be the second,
as the title-page designates it as “<span lang="fr">nouvelle edition, corrigée</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Galland’s work was speedily translated into various European languages,
and even now forms the original of all the numerous popular editions. The
earliest English editions were in six volumes, corresponding to the first six of
Galland, and ending with the story of Camaralzaman; nor was it till nearly the
end of the 18th century that the remaining half of the work was translated into
English. The date of appearance of the first edition is unknown to bibliographers;
Lowndes quotes an edition of 1724 as the oldest; but the British
Museum contains a set of six vols., made up of portions of the second, third and
fourth editions, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Vols. i. ii. (ed. 4) 1713; vols. iii. iv. (ed. 2) 1712; and vols. v. vi. (ed. 3) 1715.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here likewise the separate volumes seem to have been reprinted independently
of each other; and it is not unlikely that the English translation may have
closely followed the French publication, being issued volume by volume, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>French appeared, as far as vol. vi. The title-page of this old edition is very
quaint:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arabian-Nights Entertainments, consisting of One thousand and one
Stories, told by the Sultaness of the Indies to divert the Sultan from the Execution
of a Bloody Vow he had made, to marry a Lady every day, and have her head
cut off next Morning, to avenge himself for the Disloyalty of the first Sultaness,
also containing a better account of the Customs, Manners and Religion of the
Eastern Nations, viz., Tartars, Persians and Indians than is to be met with in
any Author hitherto published. Translated into French from the Arabian
MSS. by Mr. Galland of the Royal Academy, and now done into English.
Printed for Andrew Bell at the Cross Keys and Bible, in Cornhill.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The British Museum has an edition in 4to published in 1772, in farthing
numbers, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It extends to 79 numbers,
forming five volumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The various editions of the old English version appear to be rare, and the
set in the British Museum is very poor. The oldest edition which I have seen
containing the latter half of Galland’s version is called the 14th edition, and
was published in London in four volumes, in 1778. Curiously enough, the “13th
edition,” also containing the conclusion, was published at Edinburgh in three
volumes in 1780. Perhaps it is a reprint of a London edition published before
that of 1778. The Scotch appear to have been fond of The Nights, as
there are many Scotch editions both of The Nights and the imitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Revised or annotated editions by Piguenit (4 vols., London, 1792) and
Gough (4 vols., Edinburgh, 1798) may deserve a passing notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new translation of Galland, by Rev. E. Forster, in five vols. 4to, with
engravings from pictures by Robert Smirke, R.A., appeared in 1802; and now
commands a higher price than any other edition of Galland. A new edition in
8vo appeared in 1810. Most of the recent popular English versions are based
either upon Forster’s or Scott’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another translation from Galland by G. S. Beaumont (four vols. 8vo),
appeared in 1811. (Lowndes writes <em>Wiliam</em> Beaumont.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the various popular editions of later date we may mention an edition
in two vols., 8vo, published at Liverpool (1813), and containing Cazotte’s Continuation;
an edition published by Griffin and Co., in 1866, to which Beckford’s
“Vathek” is appended; an edition “arranged for the perusal of youthful
readers,” by the Hon. Mrs. Sugden (Whittaker &amp; Co., 1863); and “Five
Favourite Tales from The Arabian Nights in words of one syllable, by A. &amp; E.
Warner” (Lewis, 1871).</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the English editions of Galland aim at originality by arranging the
tales in a different order. The cheap edition published by Dicks in 1868 is one
instance.</p>

<p class='c000'>An English version of Galland was published at Lucknow, in four vols.,
8vo, in 1880.</p>

<p class='c000'>I should, perhaps, mention that I have not noticed De Sacy’s “<span lang="fr">Mille et une
Nuit</span>,” because it is simply a new edition of Galland; and I have not seen
either Destain’s French edition (mentioned by Sir R. F. Burton), nor Cardonne’s
Continuation (mentioned in <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, xxxvii. p. 83). As Cardonne
died in 1784, his Continuation, if genuine, would be the earliest of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest German version, by Talander, seems to have appeared in volumes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>as the French was issued; and these volumes were certainly reprinted when
required, without indication of separate editions; but in slightly varied style,
and with alteration of dates. The old German version is said to be rarer than
the French. It is in twelve parts—some, however, being double. The set
before me is clearly made up of different reprints, and the first title-page is as
follows: “<span lang="de">Die Tausend und eine Nacht, worinnen seltzame Arabische Historien
und wunderbare Begebenheiten, benebst artigen Liebes-Intriguen, auch
Sitten und Gewohnheiten der Morgenländer, auf sehr anmuthige Weise
erzehlet werden; Erstlich vom Hrn. Galland, der Königl. Academie Mitgliede
aus der Arabischen Sprache in die Französische und aus selbiger anitzo ins
Deutsche übersetzt: Erster und Anderer Theil. Mit der Vorrede Herrn
Talanders. Leipzig Verlegts Moritz Georg Weidmann Sr. Königl. Maj. in
Hohlen und Churfürstl. Durchl. zu Sachsen Buchhändler, Anno 1730.</span>”
Talander’s Preface relates chiefly to the importance of the work as illustrative
of Arabian manners and customs, &amp;c. It is dated from “Liegnitz, den 7 Sept.,
Anno 1710,” which fixes the approximate date of publication of the first part
of this translation. Vols. i. and ii. of my set (double vol. with frontispiece) are
dated 1730, and have Talander’s preface; vols. iii. and iv. (divided, but
consecutively paged, and with only one title-page and frontispiece and reprint
of Talander’s preface) are dated 1719; vols. v. and vi. (same remarks, except
that Talander’s preface is here dated 1717) are dated 1737; vol. vii. (no frontispiece;
preface dated 1710) is dated 1721; vol. 8 (no frontispiece nor preface,
nor does Talander’s name appear on the title-page) is dated 1729; vols. ix.
and x. (divided, but consecutively paged, and with only one title-page and
frontispiece; Talander’s name and preface do not appear, but Galland’s preface
to vol. ix., already mentioned, is prefixed) are dated 1731; and vols. xi. and xii.
(same remarks, but no preface) are dated 1732.</p>

<p class='c000'>Galland’s notes are translated, but not his preface and dedication.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a later German translation (6 vols. 8vo, Bremen, 1781–1785) by
J. H. Voss, the author of the standard German translation of Homer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The British Museum has just acquired a Portuguese translation of Galland,
in 4 volumes: “<span lang="pt">As Mil e uma Noites, Contos Arabes</span>,” published by Ernesto
Chardron, Editor, Porto e Braga, 1881.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two editions of a modern Greek work in the British Museum,
(1792 and 1804) published at Venice (<span lang="grc">Ενετιηριν</span>) in three small volumes. The
first volume contains Galland (Nos. 1–6 of the table) and vols. ii. and iii.
chiefly contain the Thousand and One Days. It is, apparently, translated from
some Italian work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several editions in Italian (<span lang="it">Mille ed una Notte</span>) have appeared at Naples
and Milan; they are said by Sir R. F. Burton to be mere reprints of
Galland.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, also, several in Dutch, one of which, by C. Van der Post, in
3 vols. 8vo, published at Utrecht in 1848, purports, I believe, to be a
translation from the Arabic, and has been reprinted several times. The Dutch
editions are usually entitled, “<span lang="nl">Arabische Vertellinge</span>.” A Danish edition
appeared at Copenhagen in 1818, under the title of “<span lang="da">Prindsesses Schehezerade.
Fortällinger eller de saakatle Tusende og een Nat. Udgivna paa Dansk vid
Heelegaan</span>.” Another, by Rasmassen, was commenced in 1824; and a third
Danish work, probably founded on the Thousand and One Nights, and published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>in 1816, bears the title, “<span lang="da">Digt og Eventyr fra Osterland, af arabiska og
persischen utrykta kilder</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I have seen none of these Italian, Dutch or Danish editions; but there is
little doubt that most, if not all, are derived from Galland’s work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is the title of a Javanese version, derived from one of the
Dutch editions, and published at Leyden in 1865, “<span lang="nl">Eenige Vertellingen uit de
Arabisch duizend en één Nacht. Naar de Nederduitsche vertaling in het
Javaansch vertaald, door Winter-Roorda.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. A. G. Ellis has shown me an edition of Galland’s Aladdin (No. 193) in
Malay, by M. Van der Lawan (?) printed in Batavia, A.D. 1869.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>CAZOTTE’S CONTINUATION, AND THE COMPOSITE EDITIONS OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>We shall speak elsewhere of the <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>; but the last four volumes
of this great collection (38 to 41) published at Geneva from 1788 to 1793,
contain a work entitled, “<span lang="fr">Les Veillées du Sultan Schahriar avec la Sultane
Scheherazade; histoires incroyables, amusantes et morales, traduites de l’arabe
par M. Cazotte et D. Chavis. Faisant suite aux Mille et une Nuits</span>.” Some
copies bear the abridged title of “<span lang="fr">La suite des Mille et une Nuits. Contes
Arabes, traduits par Dom Chavis et M. Cazotte</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This collection of tales was pronounced to be spurious by many critics, and
even has been styled “a bare-faced forgery” by a writer in the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> of July, 1886. It is, however, certain that the greater part, if
not all, of these tales are founded on genuine Eastern sources, though very
few have any real claim to be regarded as actually part of the Thousand and
One Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Translations of the originals of most of these tales have been published by
Caussin de Perceval and Gauttier; and a comparison clearly shows the great
extent to which Chavis and Cazotte have altered, amplified and (in a literary
sense) improved their materials.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is rather surprising that no recent edition of this work seems to have
been issued, perhaps owing to the persistent doubts cast upon its authenticity,
only a few of the tales, and those not the best, having appeared in different collections.
My friend, Mr. A. G. Ellis, himself an Oriental scholar, has remarked
to me that he considers these tales as good as the old “Arabian Nights;” and
I quite agree with him that Chavis and Cazotte’s Continuation is well worthy
of re-publication in its entirety.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are the principal tales comprised in this collection, those
included in our Table from later authors being indicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The Robber Caliph, or the Adventures of Haroun Alraschid with the
Princess of Persia, and the beautiful Zutulbe. (No. 246).</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The Power of Destiny, being the History of the Journey of Giafar to
Damas, containing the Adventures of Chelih and his Family. (No. 280).</p>

<p class='c000'>3. History of Halechalbe and the Unknown Lady. (No. 204c.).</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Story of Xailoun the Idiot.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>5. The Adventures of Simoustapha and the Princess Ilsetilsone. (No. 247).</p>

<p class='c000'>6. History of Alibengiad, Sultan of Herak, and of the False Birds of
Paradise.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. History of Sinkarib and his Two Viziers. (No. 249).</p>

<p class='c000'>8. History of the Family of the Schebandad of Surat.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Story of Bohetzad and his Ten Viziers. (No. 174).</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Story of Habib and Dorathil-Goase. (No. 251).</p>

<p class='c000'>11. History of the Maugraby, or the Magician.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these, Nos. 4, 6, 8 and 11 only are not positively known in the original.
No. 11 is interesting, as it is the seed from which Southey’s “Thalaba the
Destroyer” was derived.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the word Maugraby, which means simply Moor, Cazotte has the
following curious note: “<span lang="fr">Ce mot signifie barbare, barbaresque plus proprement.
On jure encore par lui en Provence, en Languedoc, et en Gascogne Maugraby;
ou ailleurs en France Meugrebleu</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Domdaniel, where Zatanai held his court with Maugraby and his pupil-magicians,
is described as being under the sea near Tunis. In Weil’s story of
Joodar and Mahmood (No. 201) the magician Mahmood is always called the
Moor of Tunis.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 3 (= our No. 204c) contains the additional incident of the door opened
only once a year which occurs in our No. 9a, aa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moore probably took the name Namouna from Cazotte’s No. 5, in which it
occurs. In the same story we find a curious name of a Jinniyah, Setelpedour.
Can it be a corruption of Sitt El Budoor?</p>

<p class='c000'>For further remarks on Cazotte’s Continuation, compare Russell’s History
of Aleppo, i. p. 385; and Russell and Scott, Ouseley’s Oriental Collections,
i. pp. 246, 247; ii. p. 25; and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for February, 1779.</p>

<p class='c000'>An English version under the title “Arabian Tales, or a Continuation of
the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,” translated by Robert Heron, was
published in Edinburgh in 1792 in 4 vols., and in London in 1794 in 3 vols.
It was reprinted in Weber’s “Tales of the East” (Edinburgh, 1812); and, as
already mentioned, is included in an edition of the Arabian Nights, published
in Liverpool in 1813.</p>

<p class='c000'>A German translation forms vols. 5 to 8 of the “<span lang="de">Blaue Bibliothek</span>,”
published in Gotha in 1790 and 1791; and the British Museum possesses vols. 3
and 4 of a Russian edition, published at Moscow in 1794 and 1795, which is
erroneously entered in the catalogue as the Arabian Nights in Russian.</p>

<p class='c000'>Respecting the work of Chavis and Cazotte, Sir R. F. Burton remarks, “Dom
Dennis Chavis was a Syrian priest of the order of Saint Bazil, who was invited
to Paris by the learned minister, Baron Arteuil, and he was assisted by M.
Cazotte, a French author, then well known, but wholly ignorant of Arabic.
These tales are evidently derived from native sources; the story of Bohetzad
(King Bakhtiyar) and his Ten Wazirs is taken bodily from the Bres. Edit. [not
so; but the original Arabic had long been known in the French libraries]. As
regards the style and treatment, it is sufficient to say that the authors out-Gallanded
Galland, while Heron exaggerates every fault of his original.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The first enlarged edition of Galland in French was published by Caussin
de Perceval, at Paris, in 9 vols., 8vo (1806). In addition to Galland’s version,
he added four tales (Nos. 21a, 22, 32 and 37), with which he had been furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>by Von Hammer. He also added a series of tales, derived from MSS. in the
Parisian libraries, most of which correspond to those of Cazotte.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important of the later French editions was published by E. Gauttier
in 7 vols. in 1822; it contains much new matter. At the end, the editor
gives a list of all the tales which he includes, with arguments. He has rather oddly
distributed his material so as to make only 568 nights. The full contents are
given in our Table; the following points require more special notice. Vol. i.
Gauttier omits the Third Shaykh’s story (No. 1c) on account of its indecency,
although it is really no worse than any other story in The Nights. In the story
of the Fisherman, he has fallen into a very curious series of errors. He has
misunderstood King Yunan’s reference to King Sindbad (Burton i. p. 50) to
refer to the Book of Sindibad (No. 135); and has confounded it with the story
of the Forty Vazirs, which he says exists in Arabic as well as in Turkish. Of
this latter, therefore, he gives an imperfect version, embedded in the story of
King Yunan (No. 2a). Here it may be observed that another imperfect French
version of the Forty Vazirs had previously been published by Petis de la Croix
under the title of Turkish Tales. A complete German version by Dr. Walter
F. A. Behrnauer was published at Leipzig in 1851, and an English version by
Mr. E. J. W. Gibb has appeared while these sheets are passing through the press.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. ii. After No. 6 Gauttier places versions of Nos. 32 and 184 by Langlès.
The Mock Caliph is here called Aly-Chah. The other three tales given by
Caussin de Perceval from Von Hammer’s MSS. are omitted by Gauttier. Vol. v.
(after No. 198) concludes with two additional tales (Nos. 207h and 218) from
Scott’s version. But the titles are changed, No. 207h being called the Story of
the Young Prince and the Green Bird, and No. 218 the Story of Mahmood,
although there is another story of Mahmood in vol. i. (= No. 135m) included
as part of the Forty Vazirs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. vi. includes the Ten Vazirs (No. 174) derived, however, not from the
Arabic, but from the Persian Bakhtyar Nameh. Three of the subordinate tales
in the Arabic version are wanting in Gauttier’s, and another is transferred to his
vol. vii., but he includes one, the King and Queen of Abyssinia (No. 252), which
appears to be wanting in the Arabic. The remainder of the volume contains tales
from Scott’s version, the title of Mazin of Khorassaun (No. 215) being altered to
the Story of Azem and the Queen of the Genii.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. vii. contains a series of tales of which different versions of six only
(Nos. 30, 174, 246, 248, 249 and 250) were previously published. Though these
have no claim to be considered part of The Nights, they are of sufficient interest
to receive a passing mention, especially as Gauttier’s edition seems not to have
been consulted by any later writer on The Nights, except Habicht, who based his
own edition mainly upon it. Those peculiar to Gauttier’s edition are therefore
briefly noticed.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Princess Ameny</cite> (No. 253)—A princess who leaves home disguised as a man,
and delivers another princess from a black slave. The episode (253b) is a
story of enchantment similar to Nos. 1a-c.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Aly Djohary</cite> (No. 254)—Story of a young man’s expedition in search of a
magical remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Princes of Cochin China</cite> (No. 255)—The princes travel in search of their
sister who is married to a Jinni, who is under the curse of Solomon. The second
succeeds in breaking the spell, and thus rescues both his brother, his sister, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>Jinni by killing a bird to which the destiny of the last is attached. (This incident
is common in fiction; we find it in the genuine Nights in Nos. 154a and 201.)</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Wife with Two Husbands</cite> (No. 256)—A well-known Eastern story; it
may be found in Wells’ “Mehemet the Kurd,” pp. 121–127, taken from the
Forty Vazirs. Compare Gibbs, the 24th Vazir’s Story, pp. 257–266.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Favourite</cite> (No. 257)—One of the ordinary tales of a man smuggled
into a royal harem in a chest (compare Nos. 6b and 166).</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Youssouf and the Indian Merchant</cite> (No. 258)—Story of a ruined man
travelling to regain his fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Prince Benazir</cite> (No. 258)—Story of a Prince promised at his birth, and
afterwards given up by his parents to an evil Jinni, whom he ultimately destroys.
(Such promises, especially, as here, in cases of difficult labour, are extremely
common in folk-tales; the idea probably originated in the dedication of a
child to the Gods.) Gauttier thinks that this story may have suggested that
of Maugraby to Cazotte; but it appears to me rather doubtful whether it is
quite elaborate enough for Cazotte to have used it in this manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Selim, Sultan of Egypt</cite> (No. 261)—This and its subordinate tales chiefly
relate to unfaithful wives; that of Adileh (No. 261b) is curious; she is restored
to life by Jesus (whom Gauttier, from motives of religious delicacy, turns into
a Jinni!) to console her disconsolate husband, and immediately betrays the
latter. These tales are apparently from the Forty Vazirs; cf. Gibbs, the 10th
Vazir’s Story, pp. 122–129 (= our No. 261) and the Sixth Vazir’s Story, pp. 32–84
(= No. 261b.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The bulk of the tales in Gauttier’s vol. vii. are derived from posthumous
MSS. of M. Langlès, and several have never been published in English.
Gauttier’s version of Heycar (No. 248) was contributed by M. Agoub.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best known modern German version (Tausend und Eine Nacht,
Arabische Erzahlungen, Deutsch von Max. Habicht, Fr. H. von der Hagen
und Carl Schall. Breslau, 15 vols. 12mo) is mainly based upon Gauttier’s
edition, but with extensive additions, chiefly derived from the Breslau text. An
important feature of this version is that it includes translations of the prefaces
of the various editions used by the editors, and therefore supplies a good deal
of information not always easily accessible elsewhere. There are often brief
notes at the end of the volumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifth edition of Habicht’s version is before me, dated 1840; but the
preface to vol. i is dated 1824, which maybe taken to represent the approximate
date of its first publication. The following points in the various vols. may be
specially noticed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. i. commences with the preface of the German editor, setting forth the
object and scope of his edition; and the prefaces of Gauttier and Galland follow.
No. 1c, omitted by Gauttier, is inserted in its place. Vols. ii. and iii. (No. 133),
notes, chiefly from Langlès, are appended to the Voyages of Sindbad; and
the destinations of the first six are given as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>I.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to Sumatra.
    </dd>
    <dt>II.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to Ceylon.
    </dd>
    <dt>III.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to Selahath.
    </dd>
    <dt>IV.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to the Sunda Islands.
    </dd>
    <dt>V.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to the Sunda Islands.
    </dd>
    <dt>VI.</dt>
    <dd>Voyage to Zeilan.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>Vol. v. contains an unimportant notice from Galland, with additional remarks
by the German editors, respecting the division of the work into Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>Vol. vi. contains another unimportant preface respecting Nos. 191 and 192.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. x. Here the preface is of more importance, relating to the contents of
the volume, and especially to the Ten Vazirs (No. 174).</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. xi. contains tales from Scott. The preface contains a full account of
his MSS., and the tales published in his vol. vi. This preface is taken partly
from Ouseley’s Oriental Collections, and partly from Scott’s own preface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. xii. contains tales from Gauttier, vol. vii. The preface gives the full
contents of Clarke’s and Von Hammer’s MSS.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vol. xiii. includes Caussin de Perceval’s Preface, the remaining tales from
Gauttier’s vol. vii. (ending with Night 568); and four tales from Caussin which
Gauttier omits (Nos. 21a, 22, 37 and 202).</p>

<p class='c000'>Vols. xiv. and xv. (extending from Night 884 to Night 1001) consist of tales
from the Breslau edition, to which a short preface, signed by Dr. Max. Habicht
is prefixed. The first of these tales is a fragment of the important Romance of
Seyf Zul Yesn (so often referred to by Lane), which seems to have been mixed
with Habicht’s MS. of The Nights by mistake. (Compare Payne, Tales,
iii. 243.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In this fragment we have several incidents resembling The Nights; there
is a statue which sounds an alarm when an enemy enters a city (cf. Nos. 59
and 137); Seyf himself is converted to the faith of Abraham, and enters a city
where a book written by Japhet is preserved. The text of this story has lately
been published; and Sir R. F. Burton informs me that he thinks he has seen a
complete version in some European language; but I have not succeeded in
obtaining any particulars concerning it.</p>

<p class='c000'>On account of the interest and importance of the work, I append to this
section an English version of the fragment translated into German by
Habicht. (From the extreme simplicity of the style, which I have preserved,
I suspect that the translation is considerably abridged.)</p>

<p class='c000'>There is an Icelandic version of The Nights (<span lang="is">Þúsund og ein Nott. Arabiskar
Sögur. Kaupmannahöfn, 1857</span>, 4 vols. roy. 8vo), which contains Galland’s tales,
and a selection of others, distributed into 1001 Nights, and apparently taken
chiefly from Gauttier, but with the addition of two or three which seem to be
borrowed from Lane (Nos. 9a, 163, 165, &amp;c.). It is possibly derived immediately
from some Danish edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one popular English version which may fairly be called a composite
edition; but it is not based upon Gauttier. This is the “Select Library Edition.
Arabian Nights’ Entertainments, selected and revised for general use. To
which are added other specimens of Eastern Romance. London: James
Burns, 1847. 2 vols.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It contains the following tales from The Nights: Nos. 134, 3, 133, 162, 1, 2,
155, 191, 193, 192, 194, 194a, 194c, 21, 198, 170, 6.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 134 is called the City of Silence, instead of the City of Brass, and is
certainly based partly upon Lane. In No. 155, Manar Al Sana is called Nur
Al Nissa. One story, “The Wicked Dervise,” is taken from Dow’s “Persian
Tales of Inatulla;” another “The Enchanters, or the Story of Misnar,” is
taken from the “Tales of the Genii.” Four other tales, “Jalaladdeen of
Bagdad,” “The two Talismans,” “The Story of Haschem,” and “Jussof, the
Merchant of Balsora,” clearly German imitations, are said to be translated from
the German of Grimm, and there are two others, “Abdullah and Balsora,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>and “The King and his Servant,” the origin of which I do not recognise,
although I think I have read the last before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grimm’s story of Haschem, concludes with the hero’s promotion to the post
of Grand Vizier to Haroun Al-Rashid, in consequence of the desire of the aged
“Giafar” to end his days in peaceful retirement! The principal incident in
Jalaladdeen, is that of the Old Woman in the Chest, borrowed from the well-known
story of the Merchant Abudah in the “Tales of the Genii,” and it is
thus an imitation of an imitation.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STORY OF SAIF ZUL YEZN (ZU’L YAZAN) ACCORDING TO HABICHT’S GERMAN VERSION.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>In very ancient times, long before the age of Mohammed, there lived a King
of Yemen, named Zul Yezn. He was a Himyarite of the race of Fubbaa
(Tabbá’) and had large armies and a great capital. His Minister was named
Yottreb (Yathrab = Medinat), and was well skilled in the knowledge of the
ancients. He once had a vision in which the name of the Prophet was
revealed to him, with the announcement of his mission in later times; and he
was also informed that he would be the last of the Prophets. In consequence
of this vision he believed in the Prophet before his advent; but he concealed
his faith. One day the King held a review of his troops, and was delighted
with their number and handsome appearance. He said to the Wazir, “Is
there any person on earth whose power can compare with mine?” “O yes,”
answered the Wazir, “there is King Baal-Beg, whose troops fill the deserts
and the cultivated lands, the plains and the valleys.” “I must make war
upon him, then,” exclaimed the King, “and destroy his power.” He immediately
ordered the army to prepare to march, and after a few days the drums
and trumpets were heard. The King and his Wazir set forth in magnificent
array, and after a rapid march, they arrived before the holy city Medina,
which may God keep in high renown! The Wazir then said to the King,
“Here is the holy house of God, and the place of great ceremonies. No one
should enter here who is not perfectly pure, and with head and feet bare. Pass
around it with your companions, according to the custom of the Arabs.” The
King was so pleased with the place that he determined to destroy it, to carry
the stones to his own country, and to rebuild it there, that the Arabs might
come to him on pilgrimage, and that he might thus exalt himself above all
Kings. He pondered over this plan all night, but next morning he found his
body fearfully swollen. He immediately sent for his Wazir, and lamented
over his misfortune. “This is a judgment sent upon you,” replied the Wazir,
“by the Lord of this house. If you alter your intention of destroying the
temple, you will be healed at once.” The King gave up his project, and soon
found himself cured. Soon afterwards he said to himself, “This misfortune
happened to me at night, and left me next day of its own accord; but I will
certainly destroy the house.” But next morning his face was so covered
with open ulcers that he could no longer be recognised. The Wazir then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>approached him and said, “O King, renounce your intention, for it would be
rebellion against the Lord of Heaven and Earth, who can destroy every one
who opposes him.” When the King heard this, he reflected awhile and said,
“What would you wish me to do?” The Wazir replied, “Cover the house
with carpets from Yemen.” The King resolved to do this, and when night
came he retired to rest. He then saw an apparition which ordered him not to
march further into the country of King Baal-Beg, but to turn towards Abyssinia
and Nigritia, adding, “Remain there, and choose it as thy residence, and
assuredly one of thy race will arise through whom the threat of Noah shall be
fulfilled.” When the King awoke next morning he related this to the Wazir,
who advised him to use his own judgment about it. The King immediately
gave orders to march. The army set forth, and after ten days they arrived at
a country the soil of which seemed to consist of chalk, for it appeared quite
white. The Wazir Yottreb then went to the King and requested his permission
to found a city here for his people. “Why so?” asked the King. “Because,”
replied the Wazir, “this will one day be the place of Refuge of the
Prophet Mohammed, who will be sent at the end of time.” The King then
gave his consent, and Yottreb immediately summoned architects and surveyors,
who dug out the ground, and reared the walls, and erected beautiful palaces.
They did not desist from the work until the Wazir ordered a number of his
people to remove to this city with their families. This was done, and their
posterity inhabit the city to this day. He then gave them a scroll, and said,
“He who comes to you as a fugitive to this house will be the ruler of this
city.” He then called the city Yottreb after his own name, and the scroll
descended from father to son till the Apostle of God arrived as a fugitive
from Mecca, when the inhabitants went out to meet him, and presented
him with it. They afterwards became his auxiliaries and were known as
the Ansar. But we must now return to King Zul Yezn. He marched
several days towards Abyssinia, and at last arrived in a beautiful and fertile
country where he informed his Wazir that he would like to build a city for
his subjects. He gave the necessary orders, which were diligently executed;
canals were dug and the surrounding country cultivated; and the city was
named Medinat El-Hamra, the Red. At last the news reached the King of
Abyssinia, whose name was Saif Ar-Raad (Thunder-sword), and whose capital
was called Medinat ad-Durr (the Rich in Houses). Part of this city was built
on solid land and the other was built in the sea. This prince could bring an
army of 600,000 men into the field, and his authority extended to the extremity
of the then known world. When he was informed of the invasion of Zul Yezn,
he summoned his two Wazirs, who were named Sikra Divas and Ar-Ryf.
The latter was well versed in ancient books, in which he had discovered that
God would one day send a Prophet who would be the last of the series.
He believed this himself, but concealed it from the Abyssinians, who were still
worshippers of Saturn. When the Wazirs came before the King, he said to them,
“See how the Arabs are advancing against us; I must fight them.” Sikra
Divas opposed this design, fearing lest the threat of Noah should be fulfilled.
“I would rather advise you,” said he, “to make the King a present and to
send with it the most beautiful maiden in your palace. But give her poison
secretly, and instruct her to poison the King when she is alone with him. If
he is once dead, his army will retire without a battle.” The King adopted this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>advice, and prepared rich presents, and summoned a beautiful girl, whose
artfulness and malice were well known. Her name was Kamrya (Moonlight.)
The King said to her, “I have resolved to send you as a present, for a secret
object. I will give you poison, and when you are alone with the Prince to
whom I will send you, drop it into his cup, and let him take it. As soon as he
is dead, his army will leave us in peace.” “Very well, my master,” replied the
girl, “I will accomplish your wish.” He then sent her with the other presents
and a letter to the city of Zul Yezn. But the Wazir Ar-Ryf had scarcely left
the King’s presence when he wrote a letter, and commanded a slave to carry it
to Zul Yezn. “If you can give it to him before the arrival of the slave-girl,”
added he, “I will give you your freedom.” The slave made all possible haste
to the Arab King, but yet the presents arrived before him. A chamberlain
went to the King and informed him that a messenger had arrived at the gate
with presents from the King of Abyssinia, and requested permission to enter.
Zul Yezn immediately ordered that he should be admitted, and the presents
and the maiden were at once delivered to him. When he saw her, he was
astonished at her beauty, and was greatly delighted. He immediately ordered
her to be conveyed to his palace, and was very soon overcome with love for
her. He was just about to dissolve the assembly to visit Kamrya, when the
Wazir Yottreb detained him, saying, “Delay a while, O King, for I fear there
is some treachery hidden behind this present. The Abyssinians hate the Arabs
exceedingly, but are unwilling to make war with them, lest the threat of Noah
should be fulfilled. It happened one day that Noah was sleeping when intoxicated
with wine, and the wind uncovered him. His son Ham laughed, and did not
cover him; but his other son Seth [sic] came forward, and covered him up.
When Noah awoke, he exclaimed to Ham, ‘May God blacken thy face!’
But to Seth he said, ‘May God make the posterity of thy brother the servants
of thine until the day of Resurrection!’ This is the threat which they dread
as the posterity of Ham.” While the King was still conversing with his Wazir, the
Chamberlain announced the arrival of a messenger with a letter. He was
immediately admitted, and delivered the letter, which was read by the Wazir
Yottreb. Ar-Ryf had written, “Be on your guard against Kamrya, O King,
for she hath poison with her, and is ordered to kill you when she is alone
with you.” The King now began loudly to praise the acuteness of his Wazir,
and went immediately to Kamrya with his drawn sword. When he entered, she
rose and kissed the ground, but he exclaimed, “You have come here to poison
me!” She was confounded, and took out the poison, and handed it to the
King, full of artifice, and thinking “If I tell him the truth, he will have a better
opinion of me, and if he confides in me, I can kill him in some other manner
than with this poison.” It fell out as she expected, for the King loved her,
gave her authority over his palace and his female slaves, and found himself
very happy in her possession. But she herself found her life so pleasant that,
although King Ar-Raad frequently sent to ask her why she had not fulfilled
her commission, she always answered, “Wait a little; I am seeking an opportunity,
for the King is very suspicious.” Some time passed over, and at length
she became pregnant. Six months afterwards Zul Yezn fell ill; and as his
sickness increased, he assembled the chief men of his Court, informed them of
the condition of Kamrya, and after commending her to their protection, he
ordered that if she bore a son, he should succeed him. They promised to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>fulfil his commands, and a few days afterwards Zul Yezn died. Kamrya now
governed the country, till she brought forth a son. He was a child of uncommon
beauty, and had a small mole on his cheek. When she saw the child she
envied him, and said to herself, “What, shall he take away the kingdom from
me? No, it shall never be;” and from this time forward she determined to
put him to death. After forty days, the people requested to see their King.
She showed him to them, and seated him on the throne of the kingdom, whereupon
they did homage to him, and then dispersed. His mother took him
back into the Palace, but her envy increased so much that she had already
grasped a sword to kill him, when her nurse entered and asked what she was
going to do? “I am about to kill him,” answered she. “Have you not reflected?”
said the nurse, “that if you kill him the people will revolt, and may kill you
also?” “Let me kill him,” persisted she; “for even should they kill me too,
I should at least be released from my envy.” “Do not act thus,” warned the
nurse, “or you may repent it, when repentance cannot help you.” “It must be
done,” said Kamrya. “Nay, then,” said the nurse, “if it cannot be avoided,
let him at least be cast into the desert, and if he lives, so much the better for
him; but if he dies, you are rid of him for ever.” She followed this advice
and set out on the way at night time with the child, and halted at a distance of
four days’ journey, when she sat down under a tree in the desert. She took
him on her lap, and suckled him once more, and then laid him on a bed,
putting a purse under his head, containing a thousand gold pieces and many
jewels. “Whoever finds him,” said she, “may use the money to bring him
up;” and thus she left him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened by the gracious decree of God, that hunters who were chasing
gazelles, surprised a female with a fawn; the former took to flight, and the
hunters carried off the little one. When the mother returned from the pasture,
and found her fawn gone, she traversed the desert in all directions in search of
it, and at length the crying of the deserted child attracted her. She lay down
by the child, and the child sucked her. The gazelle left him again to go to
graze, but always returned to the little one when she was satisfied. This went
on till it pleased God that she should fall into the net of a hunter. But she
became enraged, tore the net, and fled. The hunter pursued her, and overtook
her when she reached the child, and was about to give him suck. But the
arrival of the hunter compelled the gazelle to take to flight, and the child began
to cry, because he was not yet satisfied. The hunter was astonished at the
sight, and when he lifted the child up, he saw the purse under his head, and a
string of jewels round his neck. He immediately took the child with him, and
went to a town belonging to an Abyssinian king named Afrakh, who was a
dependent of King Saif Ar-Raad. He handed over the child to him, saying
that he had found it in the lair of a gazelle. When the King took the child
into his care, it smiled at him, and God awakened a feeling of love towards
him in the King’s heart; and he then noticed the mole on his cheek. But
when his Wazir Sikar Diun, the brother of Sikar Divas, who was Wazir to
King Saif Ar-Raad, entered and saw the child, God filled his heart with hate
towards him. “Do not believe what this man told you,” he said, when the
King told him the wonderful story of the discovery, “it can only be the child
of a mother who has come by it wrongly, and has abandoned it in the desert,
and it would be better to kill it.” “I cannot easily consent to this,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>King. But he had hardly spoken, when the palace was filled with sounds of
rejoicing, and he was informed that his wife had just been safely delivered of a
child. On this news he took the boy on his arm, and went to his wife, and
found that the new-born child was a girl, and that she had a red mole on her
cheek. He wondered when he saw this, and said to Sikar Diun, “See how
beautiful they are!” But when the Wazir saw it, he slapped his face, and
cast his cap on the ground, exclaiming, “Should these two moles unite,
I prophesy the downfall of Abyssinia, for they presage a great calamity. It
would be better to kill either the boy or your daughter.” “I will kill neither
of them,” replied the King, “for they have been guilty of no crime.” He
immediately provided nurses for the two children, naming his daughter Shama
(Mole) and the boy Wakhs<a id='r471' href='#f471' class='c016'><sup>[471]</sup></a> El Fellat (Lonely one, or Desert); and he reared
them in separate apartments, that they might not see each other. When they
were ten years old, Wakhs El Fellat grew very strong, and soon became a
practised horseman, and surpassed all his companions in this accomplishment,
and in feats of arms. But when he was fifteen, he was so superior to all others,
that Sikar Diun threatened the King that he would warn King Saif Ar-Raad
that he was nurturing his enemy in his house, if he did not immediately banish
him from the country; and this threat caused King Afrakh great alarm. It
happened that he had a general, who was called Gharag El Shaker (Tree-splitter),
because he was accustomed to hurl his javelin at trees, and thus to
cleave them asunder. He had a fortress three days’ journey from the town;
and the King said to him, “Take Wakhs El Fellat to your castle, and never
let him return to this neighbourhood.” He added privately, “Look well after
him and preserve him from all injury, and have him instructed in all accomplishments.”
The general withdrew, and took the boy with him to his castle, and
instructed him thoroughly in all accomplishments and sciences. One day he
said to him, “One warlike exercise is still unknown to you.” “What is that?”
said Wakhs El Fellat. “Come and see for yourself,” replied he. The general
then took him to a place where several trees were growing, which were so thick
that a man could not embrace the trunk. He then took his javelin, hurled it at
one of them, and split the trunk. Wakhs El Fellat then asked for the javelin,
and performed the same feat, to the astonishment of his instructor. “Woe to
thee!” exclaimed he, “for I perceive that you are the man through whom the
threat of Noah will be fulfilled against us. Fly, and never let yourself be seen
again in our country, or I will kill you.” Wakhs El Fellat then left the town,
not knowing where to go. He subsisted for three days on the plants of
the earth, and at last he arrived at a town encircled by high walls, the gates
of which were closed. The inhabitants were clothed in black, and uttered
cries of lamentation. In the foreground he saw a bridal tent, and a tent of
mourning. This was the city of King Afrakh who had reared him, and the
cause of the mourning of the inhabitants was as follows. Sikar Diun was very
angry that the King had refused to follow his advice, and put the boy to death,
and had left the town to visit one of his friends, who was a magician, to whom
he related the whole story. “What do you propose to do now?” asked the
magician. “I will attempt to bring about a separation between him and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>daughter,” said the Wazir. “I will assist you,” was the answer of the magician.
He immediately made the necessary preparations, and summoned an evil Jinni
named Mukhtatif (Ravisher) who inquired, “What do you require of me?”
“Go quickly to the city of King Afrakh, and contrive that the inhabitants shall
leave it.” In that age men had intercourse with the more powerful Jinn, and
each attained their ends by means of the other. The Jinn did not withdraw
themselves till after the advent of the Prophet. The Magician continued,
“When the inhabitants have left the city, they will ask you what you want.”
Then say, “Bring me out Shama, the daughter of your King, adorned with all
her jewels, and I will come to-morrow and carry her away. But if you refuse,
I will destroy your city, and destroy you all together.” When Mukhtatif heard
the words of this priest of <span lang="la">magis</span>, he did as he was commanded, and rushed
to the city. When Sikar Diun saw this, he returned to King Afrakh to see
what would happen; but he had scarcely arrived when the voice of Mukhtatif
resounded above the city. The inhabitants went to the King, and said, “You
have heard what is commanded, and if you do not yield willingly, you will be
obliged to do so by force.” The King then went weeping to the mother of the
Princess, and informed her of the calamity. She could scarcely contain herself
for despair, and all in the palace wept at parting from the Princess. Meantime
Shama was richly attired, torn from her parents, and hurried to the bridal tent
before the town, to be carried away by the evil Jinni. The inhabitants were
all assembled on the walls of the city, weeping. It was just at this moment
that Wakhs El Fellat arrived from the desert, and entered the tent to see what
was going on. When King Afrakh, who was also on the wall, saw him, he cried
out to him, but he did not listen, and dismounted, fastened his horse to a tent-stake,
and entered. Here he beheld a maiden of extraordinary beauty and
perfection, but she was weeping. While he was completely bewildered by her
beauty, she was no less struck by his appearance. “Who art thou?” said the
maiden to him. “Tell me rather who art thou?” returned he. “I am Shama,
the daughter of King Afrakh.” “Thou art Shama?” he exclaimed, “and I am
Wakhs El Fellat, who was reared by thy father.” When they were thus
acquainted, they sat down together to talk over their affairs, and she took this
opportunity of telling him what had passed with the Jinni, and how he was
coming to carry her away. “O, you shall see how I will deal with him,” answered
he, but at this moment the evil Jinni approached, and his wings darkened
the sun. The inhabitants uttered a terrible cry, and the Jinni darted upon
the tent, and was about to raise it when he saw a man there, talking to the
daughter of the King. “Woe to thee, O son of earth,” he exclaimed, “What
authority have you to sit by my betrothed?” When Wakhs El Fellat saw the
terrible form of the Jinni, a shudder came over him, and he cried to God for
aid. He immediately drew his sword, and struck at the Jinni who had just
extended his right hand to seize him, and the blow was so violent that it struck
off the hand. “What, you would kill me?” exclaimed Mukhtatif, and he took
up his hand, put it under his arm, and flew away. Upon this there was a loud
cry of joy from the walls of the city. The gates were thrown open, and King
Afrakh approached, companied by a crowd of people with musical instruments,
playing joyful music; and Wakhs El Fellat was invested with robes of honour:
but when Sikar Diun saw it it was gall to him. The King prepared an
apartment expressly for Wakhs El Fellat, and while Shama returned to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>palace, he gave a great feast in honour of her deliverance from the fiend. After
seven days had passed, Shama went to Wakhs El Fellat, and said to him,
“Ask me of my father to-morrow, for you have rescued me, and he will not be
able to refuse you.” He consented very willingly, and went to the King early
next morning. The King gave him a very favourable reception, and seated
him with him on the throne; but Wakhs El Fellat had not courage to prefer
his suit, and left him after a short interview. He had not long returned to his
own room, when Shama entered, saluted him, and asked, “Why did you not
demand me?” “I was too bashful,” he replied. “Lay this feeling aside,”
returned she, “and demand me.” “Well, I will certainly do so to-morrow,”
answered he. Thereupon she left him, and returned to her own apartment.
Early next morning Wakhs El Fellat went again to the King, who gave him a
friendly reception, and made him sit with him. But he was still unable to prefer
his suit, and returned to his own room. Soon after Shama came to him and
said, “How long is this bashfulness to last? Take courage, and if not, request
some one else to speak for you.” She then left him, and next morning he
repeated his visit to the King. “What is your request?” asked the latter.
“I am come as a suitor,” said Wakhs El Fellat, “and ask the hand of your
noble daughter Shama.” When Sikar Diun heard this, he slapped his face.
“What is the matter with you?” asked the King. “This is what I have
foreseen,” answered he, “for if these two moles unite, the destruction of
Abyssinia is accomplished.” “How can I refuse him?” replied the King,
“when he has just delivered her from the fiend.” “Tell him,” answered Sikar
Diun, “that you must consult with your Wazir.” The King then turned to
Wakhs El Fellat, and said, “My son, your request is granted as far as I am
concerned, but I leave my Wazir to arrange it with you, so you must consult
him about it.” Wakhs El Fellat immediately turned to the Wazir, and
repeated his request to him. Sikar Diun answered him in a friendly manner.
“The affair is as good as arranged, no one else is suited for the King’s daughter,
but you know that the daughters of the Kings require a dowry.” “Ask what
you please,” returned Wakhs El Fellat. “We do not ask you for money or
money’s worth,” said the Wazir, “but for the head of a man named Sudun,
the Ethiopian.” “Where can I find him?” said the prince. The Wazir
replied, “He is said to dwell in the fortress of Reg, three days’ journey
from here.” “But what if I fail to bring the head of Sudun?” asked he.
“But you will have it,” returned the Wazir; and after this understanding the
audience ceased, and each returned to his dwelling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now this Sudun had built his fortress on the summit of a high hill. It
was very secure, and he defended it with the edge of the sword. It was his
usual resort, from whence he sallied forth on plundering expeditions, and
rendered the roads unsafe. At length the news of him reached King Saif Ar-Raad,
who sent against him three thousand men, but he routed and destroyed
them all. Upon this, the King sent a larger number against him, who
experienced the same fate. He then despatched a third army, upon which
Sudun fortified himself afresh, and reared the walls of his fortress so high that
an eagle could scarcely pass them. We will now return to Shama, who went
to Wakhs El Fellat, and reproached him with the conditions he had agreed to,
and added, “It would be better for you to leave this place, and take me with
you, and we will put ourselves under the protection of some powerful king.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>“God forbid,” replied he, “that I should take you with me in so dishonourable
a manner.” As he still positively refused to consent, she grew angry, and left
him. Wakhs El Fellat lay down to rest, but he could not sleep. So he rose
up, mounted his horse, and rode away at midnight; and in the morning he met
a horseman who stationed himself in his path, but who was so completely armed
that his face was concealed. When Wakhs El Fellat saw him, he cried to him,
“Who are you, and where are you going?” But instead of replying, he
pressed upon him, and aimed a blow which Wakhs El Fellat successfully
parried. A fight then commenced between them, which lasted till nearly evening.
At last the difference in their strength became perceptible, and Wakhs El
Fellet struck his adversary so violent a blow with his javelin that his horse fell
to the ground. He then dismounted, and was about to slay him, when the
horseman cried to him, “Do not kill me, O brave warrior, or you will repent
when repentance will no more avail you.” “Tell me who you are?” returned
Wakhs El Fellat. “I am Shama, the daughter of King Afrakh,” replied the
horseman. “Why have you acted thus?” asked he. “I wished to try whether
you would be able to hold your own against Sudun’s people,” she replied. “I
have tried you now, and found you so valiant that I fear no longer on your
account. Take me with you, O hero.” “God forbid that I should do so,”
he returned; “what would Sikar Diun and the others say? They would say
that if Shama had not been with him, he would never have been able to prevail
against Sudun.” She then raised her eyes to heaven, and said, “O God, permit
him to fall into some danger from which I alone may deliver him!” Upon this
Wakhs El Fellat pursued his journey, without giving any attention to her
words. On the third day he arrived at the valley where the fortress of
Sudun was situated, when he began to work his way along behind the trees;
and towards evening he arrived at the fortress itself, which he found to be surrounded
with a moat; and the gates were closed. He was still undecided what
course to take, when he heard the sound of an approaching caravan; and he
hid himself in the fosse of the fortress to watch it. He then saw that it was
driven forward by a large body of men, and that the merchants were bound on
their mules. When they arrived at the castle, they knocked at the gate; and
when the troop entered, Wakhs El Fellat entered with them; and they unloaded
the goods and bound the prisoners without noticing him. When the armed
men had finished their work, they ascended to the castle, but he remained
below. After a time, he wished to follow them, but when he trod on the first
step, it gave way under him, and a dagger flew out, which struck him in the
groin. Upon this his eyes filled with tears, and he already looked upon his
destruction as certain, when a form came towards him from the entrance of the
castle, to deliver him; and as it drew nearer, he perceived that it was Shama.
He was filled with astonishment, and cried out, “God has heard your prayer!
How did you come here?” “I followed your traces,” she replied, “till you
entered the castle, when I imitated your example, and mingled with the troops.
I have now saved your life, although you have refused to take me with you;
but if you wish to advance further, do not neglect to try whether each step
is fixed, with the point of your sword.” He now again began to ascend, feeling
the way before him, and Shama followed, till they arrived at the last stair, when
they saw that the staircase ended in a revolving wheel. “Spring higher,”
advised Shama, “for I see a javelin which magic art has placed here.” They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>sprang over it, and pursued their way till they reached a large anteroom, lighted
by a high cupola. They stopped here awhile, and examined everything carefully.
At last they approached the door of a room, and on looking through the
crevices, they saw about a hundred armed negroes, among whom was a black
slave who looked as savage as a lion. The room was lighted by wax candles,
placed on gold and silver candlesticks. At this moment, the black said,
“Slaves, what have you done with the prisoners belonging to the caravan?”
“We have chained them up in the prison below, and left them in the safest
place,” was the reply. But he continued, “If one of them was carelessly
bound, he might be able to release himself and the others, and to gain
possession of the stairs. Let one of you therefore go down, examine them
carefully, and tighten their bonds.” One of them therefore came out, and the
two strangers hid themselves in the anteroom. When he had passed
them, Wakhs El Fellat stepped forward and pierced him through with
his sword; Shama dragged his body aside, and they both remained
quiet for a time. But as the slave remained away from his companions
too long, Sudun exclaimed, “Go and see why he does not
return, for I have been in great alarm ever since we entered the castle
to-day.” A second then rose and took his sword, and as he came into the
anteroom, Wakhs El Fellat clove him in twain at one blow and Shama
dragged his body also on one side. They again waited quietly for a time, when
Sudun said, “It seems as if hunters are watching our slaves, and are killing
them one after another.” A third then hastened out, and Wakhs El Fellat
struck him such a blow that he fell dead to the ground, and Shama dragged
him also away. But as he likewise remained absent so long, Sudun himself
stood up, and all the others with him, and he said, “Did I not warn and
caution you? There is a singing in my ears, and my heart trembles, for there
must be people here who are watching our men.” He himself now came out,
and the others followed him with lights and holding their hands on their
swords, when one of the foremost suddenly stopped. “Why do you not
advance!” cried the others. “How shall I go forward,” said he, “when he
who has slain our friends stands before us.” This answer was repeated to
Sudun when he called on them in a voice of thunder to advance. When he
heard this, he forced his way through them till he perceived Wakhs El Fellat.
“Who are you, Satan?” cried he, “and who brought you here?” “I came
here,” replied he, “to cut off your head, and destroy your memory.” “Have
you any blood-feud against me?” asked Sudun, “or any offence to revenge
upon me?” “I have no enmity against you in my heart,” said Wakhs El
Fellat, “and you have never injured me; but I have asked Shama in marriage
of her father, and he has demanded of me your head as a condition. Be on
your guard, that you may not say I acted foully towards you.” “Madman,”
cried Sudun, “I challenge you to a duel. Will you fight inside or outside the
fortress?” “I leave that to you,” returned Wakhs El Fellat. “Well, then,
await me here,” was the reply. Sudun then went in, clothed himself in gilded
armour, girt on a saw-like sword, and came out holding a shining club in his
hand. He was so enraged that he knew not what to say, and at once attacked
Wakhs El Fellat, who threw himself on his adversary like a raging lion, and they
fought together like hungry wolves; but both despaired of victory. The swords
spake a hard language on the shields, and each of the combatants wished that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>had never been born. When this desperate fight had lasted a long time, Shama
was greatly troubled lest Sudun should prove victorious. So she seized a dagger
and struck at Sudun, wounding the nerves of his hand, so that he dropped his
sword, while she exclaimed to Wakhs El Fellat, “Make an end of him.”
“No,” replied Wakhs El Fellat, “I will make him my prisoner, for he is a
brave and valiant man.” “With whom are you speaking?” asked Sudun.
“With Shama,” answered he. “What,” said Sudun, “did she come with
you?” “Yes,” replied he. “Then let her come before me.” She came
forward, and Sudun said, “Is the world too narrow for your father that he could
demand nothing as your dowry but my head?” “This was his desire,”
answered she. Wakhs El Fellat then said, “Take your sword and defend
yourself, for I will not fight with you, now that it has fallen out of your hand.”
But Sudun replied, “I will not fight with you, for I am wounded, so take my
head, and go in peace with your bride.” He then sat down and bowed his head.
“If you speak truly,” said Wakhs El Fellat, “separate yourself from your
people.” “Why so?” “Because I fear lest they may surround me, and
compel me to fight with them, and there is no need for me to shed their blood.”
Sudun then left the castle, bowed his head, and said, “Finish your work.”
But Wakhs El Fellat said, “If you speak truth, come with me across the fosse
of the castle into the open ground.” He did so, carefully barring the castle
behind him, and said, “Now take my head.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the slaves saw this, they mounted the walls, and wept and lamented.
But Shama cried out, “Take his head, and let us hasten our return before
morning dawns.” “What,” said Wakhs El Fellat, “should I kill so brave a man
in so treacherous a manner, when he is so noble and magnanimous?” He then
went up to Sudun, kissed his head, and said, “Rise up, O warrior of the age,
for you and your companions are safe from me.” They now all embraced each
other, and made an offensive and defensive compact. “Take me with you
alive, O brave man,” said Sudun, “and hand me over to the King as his
daughter’s dowry. If he consents, well; but if not, take my head, and woo
your wife.” “God forbid,” said Wakhs El Fellat, “that I should act thus after
your magnanimity. Rather return to the castle, and assure your companions of
your safety.” All this passed under the eyes of the other armed men. They
rejoiced at the knightly conduct of both, and now came down, fell at the feet of
Sudun and embraced him. They then did the same to Wakhs El Fellat, whose
hands they kissed and loaded him with praises. After this, they all returned to
the castle, and agreed to set out presently. They took with them whatever
treasures there were, and Wakhs El Fellat commanded them to release the
prisoners and restore them their goods. They now all mounted their horses
and journeyed to the country of King Afrakh, greatly rejoiced at the
mutual love of the warriors. When they approached the town, Shama parted
from them, that nothing should be known of her absence in the company.
During this time, King Afrakh and Sikar Diun had amused themselves with
hunting, jesting, and sporting, and sent out scouts daily to look for Wakhs El
Fellat. “What can have become of him?” said the King once to Sikar Diun.
“Sudun has certainly killed him,” replied the latter, “and you will never see
him again.” While they were thus talking, they observed a great cloud of
dust, and as it drew nearer, they could see the armed men more distinctly.
The company was led by a black knight, by whose side rode a younger white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>horseman. When the King saw this, he exclaimed, “Wakhs El Fellat has
returned, in company with Sudun and his host.” “Wait a little,” replied Sikar
Diun, “till we are certain of it.” But when they drew nearer, and they could
doubt no longer, Sikar Diun mounted his horse and fled, accompanied by the King
and his followers, till they reached the town, and barred the gates. They then
watched from the walls, to see what would happen. When they saw that the
strangers dismounted and pitched tents, the King thought it was a good sign.
He therefore ordered the town to be decorated, and the gates to be opened,
and rode out, attended by a considerable escort, and approached the tents.
The other party now mounted their horses to go to meet them. When they
approached each other, King Afrakh was about to dismount, but Wakhs El-Fellat
would not allow it, and the King embraced him, and congratulated him
on his safety. He then saluted Sudun also, but the latter did not return his
salutation. He invited him to enter the town, but he declined, as did Wakhs
El Fellat likewise, who did not wish to part from his companions. The
King returned accompanied only by his own people, and prepared the best
reception for the new-comers. On the following morning the King held a
general council, at which Sikar Diun appeared greatly depressed. “Did I not
warn you beforehand,” said he to the King, “what you now see for yourself of
this evil-doer? Did we not send him to bring the head of Sudun, and he
returns with him safe and sound, and on the best of terms, while our hearts
are oppressed with anxiety?” “You may be right,” replied the King, “but
what are we to do now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>This conversation was interrupted by a tumult caused by the arrival of
Wakhs El Fellat and Sudun, who came to pay their respects to the King.
The King invited them to sit down, but Sudun remained standing, and when
he asked him again, he replied, “You craven, was the world too narrow for you
that you desired my head as your daughter’s dowry?” “Sit down,” said the
King, “for I know that you are angry.” “How can I sit down,” returned Sudun,
“when you have ordered my death?” “God forbid that I should act so
unjustly,” said the King; “it was Sikar Diun.” “What,” said he, “do you
accuse me of such an action in my presence?” “Did you not make this
condition with Wakhs El Fellat,” said the King, “and send him on his errand?”
Sikar Diun then turned to Sudun, and said, “Sit down, brave warrior, for we
only did so from love to you, that we might be able to make a treaty with you, and
that you might join our company.” After this answer, Sudun concealed his anger,
and sat down. Refreshments were now brought in, and after partaking of them,
Wakhs El Fellat and Sudun returned to their tents. Several days passed in
this manner, and at length Sudun said to Wakhs El Fellat, “O my master,
it is time for you to demand Shama in marriage, now you have won her with
the edge of the sword. You have fulfilled their conditions long since by
bringing them my head, but you have made no further progress at present.
Ask for her once more, and if they will not give her up, I will fall upon them
with the sword, and we will carry Shama off, and then lay waste the city.” “I
will demand her as my wife again to-morrow,” replied the other. When he
went to the palace next day, he found the King and all the court assembled.
When they saw him, they all rose from their seats, and when they sat down again,
he alone remained standing. “Why do you not sit down,” said the King, “for
all your wishes are now fulfilled?” “I have still to ask for Shama,” he replied.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>“You know,” returned the King, “that ever since her birth I have allowed
Sikar Diun to make all arrangements for her.” He now turned to Sikar Diun,
who replied in a friendly tone, “She is yours, for you have fulfilled the conditions,
and you have only now to give her ornaments.” “What kind of
ornaments?” asked he. “Instead of ornaments,” replied the traitor, “we
desire to receive a book containing the history of the Nile. If you bring
it us, she is wholly yours, but if not, there is no marriage to be thought of.”
“Where is it to be found?” “I cannot tell you myself.” “Well then,” returned
Wakhs El Fellat, “if I do not bring you the book, Shama is lost to me; all
present are witnesses to this.” He went out with these words, pushing his way
through the crowded assembly, and Sudun behind him, till they reached their tents.
“Why did you promise that,” said Sudun, “let us rather overcome them with
the sword, and take Shama from them.” “Not so,” replied Wakhs El Fellat,
“I will only possess her honourably.” “And yet you do not even know how to
find the book,” said Sudun; “rather listen to my advice, retire to my fortress,
and leave me in their power.” “I would never act thus,” said Wakhs El
Fellat, “though I should suffer death.” After these and similar speeches,
supper was brought in, and each retired to his sleeping apartment. But
Wakhs El Fellat had scarcely entered his room when Shama came in. “What
have you done,” said she, “and what engagement have you undertaken? How
can you fulfil this condition? Do you not see that their only object is to destroy
you, or at least to get rid of you? I have come to warn you again, and I
say to you once more, take me with you to Sudun’s castle, where we can
live at peace, and do not act as they tell you.” “I will carry out my engagement,”
he replied; “I will not possess you like a coward, even though I should
be cut to pieces with swords.” Upon this, Shama was angry and left him, while
he lay down to rest, but could not sleep. He therefore rose up, saddled and
mounted his horse and rode away, without knowing where, abandoning himself
wholly to the will of God. He wandered about thus for several days, until he
reached a lonely tower. He knocked at the door, and a voice answered,
“Welcome O thou who hast separated thyself from thy companions; enter without
fear, O brave Saif, son of Zul Yezn.” When he pushed the door it opened,
and his eyes beheld a noble and venerable old man, from whose appearance it
was at once obvious that he busied himself with the strictest life and fear of God.
“Welcome,” cried he again; “if you had travelled from east to west you would
have found no one who could show you how to obtain the book you seek as well
as I can, for I have dwelt here awaiting your arrival for sixty years.” “But that
was before I was born,” said Wakhs El Fellat to himself. He then asked aloud,
“By what name did you address me just now?” “O Saif,” answered the old
man, “that is your true name, for you are a sword (Saíf) to the Abyssinians: but
whom do you worship?” “O my master,” was the reply, “the Abyssinians
worship Saturn (Sukhal) but I am in perplexity, and know not whom to worship.”
“My son,” replied the old man, “worship Him who has reared the heavens over
us without pillars, and who has rested the earth on water; the only and eternal
God, the Lord who is only and alone to be reverenced. I worship Him and none
other beside him, for I follow the religion of Abraham.” “What is your name?”
asked Wakhs El Fellat. “I am called Shaikh Gyat.” “What declaration must
I make,” he asked the old man, “to embrace your religion?” “Say ‘There is
no God but God, and Abraham is the Friend of God.’ If you make this profession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>you will be numbered among the believers.” He at once repeated the
formula, and Shaikh Gyat was much pleased, and devoted the night to teaching
him the history of Abraham and his religion, and the forms of worship. Towards
morning he said, “O my son, whenever you advance to battle, say, ’God is
great, grant me victory, O God, and destroy the infidels,’ and help will be
near you. Now pursue your journey, but leave your horse here until your
return. Enter the valley before you, under the protection of God, and after
three days you will meet some one who will aid you.” Wakhs El Fellat set out
on that road, and after three days he met a horseman who saluted him, and
exclaimed, “Welcome, Saif Zul Yezn, for you bring happiness to this neighbourhood.”
Saif returned his salutation, and asked, “How do you know me, and how
do you know my name?” “I am not a brave or renowned warrior,” was the
answer, “but one of the maidens of this country and my mother taught me your
name.” “What is your name and that of your mother?” “My mother’s name
is Alka,” answered she, “and I am called Taka.” When he heard this he was
greatly rejoiced, for he remembered that Shaikh Gyat had said to him, “O thou,
whose destiny will be decided by Alka and Taka.” “O noble virgin,” said
he, “where is your mother, Alka?” “Look round,” she replied; and he saw a
very large and lofty city at some distance. “Know,” said she, “that 360
experienced philosophers dwell in that city. My mother Alka is their superior,
and directs all their affairs and actions. She knew that you would come to this
neighbourhood in search of a book concerning the Nile, which was written by
Japhet, the son of Noah, and she wishes you to attain your end by her means.
She also informed me of your coming, and promised me to you, saying, ‘You
shall have no other husband but him.’ We expected you to-day, and she sent
me to meet you, adding, ‘Warn him not to enter the town by daylight, or it will
be his destruction.’ Wait here, therefore, till nightfall, and only approach the
city after dark. Turn to the right along the wall, and stand still when you reach
the third tower, where we will await you. As soon as we see you we will throw
you a rope; bind it round your waist, and we will draw you up. The rest will
be easy.” “But why need you give yourselves all this trouble?” said Saif Zul
Yezn. “Know,” replied she, “that the inhabitants of this city have been informed
of your approaching arrival by their books, and are aware that you are
about to carry away their book, which they hold in superstitious reverence. On
the first day of each month they repair to the building where it is preserved;
and they adore it and seek counsel from it respecting their affairs. They have
also a king whose name is Kamrun. When they knew that you were coming
for the book they constructed a talisman against you. They have made a copper
statue, and fixed a brazen horn in its hand, and have stationed it at the gate
of the city. If you enter, the statue will sound the horn, and it will only
do so upon your arrival. They would then seize you and put you to death.
On this account we desire to baffle their wisdom, by drawing you up
to the walls of the city at another place.” “May God reward you a
thousandfold,” replied he; “but go now, and announce my arrival to your
mother.” She went away, and he approached the city in the darkness of
night, and turned towards the third tower on the right, where he found Alka
and Taka. When they recognised him, they immediately threw him the rope,
which he fastened about him. When he was drawn up, they descended from the
wall, and were about to proceed to Alka’s house, when the talisman suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>acted, and the statue blew the horn loudly. “Hasten to our house,” cried
Alka; and they succeeded in reaching it safely and barred the doors, when the
noise increased. The whole population of the city rose up, and the streets were
filled. “What is this disturbance about?” asked Saif. “This is all due,”
replied Alka, “to the alarm sounded by the statue, because you have entered
the town. There will be a great meeting held to-morrow, where all the wise
men will assemble, to attempt to discover the whereabouts of the intruder; but
by God’s help, I will guide them wrong, and confuse their counsels. Go to our
neighbour the fisherman,” added she to her daughter, “and see what he has
caught.” She went, and brought news that he had taken a large fish, of the
size of a man. “Take this piece of gold,” said her mother, “and bring us the
fish” and when she did so, she told her to clean it, which was done. Food was
then brought in, and they ate and talked. The night passed quietly, but on the
following morning Alka ordered Saif Zul Yezn to undress, and to hide in the
skin of the fish. She put her mouth to the mouth of the fish, and took a
long rope, which she fastened under Saif’s armpits. She then let him
down into a deep well, and fastened him there, saying, “Remain here,
till I come back.” She then left him, and went to the great hall of the King,
where the divan was already assembled, and the King had taken his seat
on the throne. All rose up when she entered, and when she had seated
herself, the King said to her, “O mother, did you not hear the blast of the horn
yesterday, and why did you not come out with us?” “I did hear it,” she
replied, “but I did not heed it.” “But you know,” said he, “that the sound
can only be heard upon the arrival of the stranger who desires to take the
book.” “I know it, O King; but permit me to choose forty men from among
those assembled here.” She did so, and selected ten from among the forty
again. She then said to them, “Take a Trakhtramml (sandboard) on which the
Arabs practise geomancy and notation, and look and search.” They did so, but
had scarcely finished when they looked at each other in amazement. They
destroyed their calculation, and began a second, and confused this too, and began
a third, upon which they became quite confounded. “What are you doing
there?” asked the King at last. “You go on working and obliterating your
work; what have you discovered?” “O King,” replied they, “we find that the
stranger has entered the town, but not by any gate. He appears to have passed
in between Heaven and earth, like a bird. After this, a fish swallowed him,
and carried him down into some dark water.” “Are you fools?” asked the
King angrily; and turning to Alka, continued, “Have you ever seen a man flying
between Heaven and earth, and afterwards swallowed by a fish, which descends
with him into dark water?” “O King,” replied she, “I always forbid the
wise men to eat heavy food, for it disturbs their understanding and weakens
their penetration; but they will not heed me.” At this the King was angry,
and immediately drove them from the hall. But Alka said, “It will be plain
to-morrow what has happened.” She left the hall, and when she reached home,
she drew Saif Zul Yezn out of the well, and he dressed himself again. They sat
down, and Alka said, “I have succeeded in confounding their deliberations
to-day! and there will be a great assembly to-morrow, when I must hide you in
a still more out-of-the-way place.” After this they supped, and went to rest.
Next morning Alka called her daughter, and said, “Bring me the gazelle.”
When it was brought her, she said, “Bring me the wings of an eagle.” Taka
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>gave them to her, and she bound them on the back of the gazelle. She then
took a pair of compasses, which she fixed in the ceiling of the room. She next
took two other pairs of compasses, and tied one between the fore feet, and the
other between the hind feet of the gazelle. She then tied a rope to the compasses
in the roof, and the two ends to the other pairs. But she made Saif
Zul Yezn lie down in such a position that his head was between the feet of the
gazelle. She then said to him, “Remain here till I come back”; and
went to the King; with whom she found a very numerous assemblage of the
wise men. As soon as she entered, the King made her sit beside him on the
throne. “O my mother Alka,” he said, “I could not close an eye last night
from anxiety concerning yesterday’s events.” “Have you no wise men,”
returned she, “who eat the bread of the divan?” She then turned to them,
saying, “Select the wisest among you!” and they chose the wisest among
them. She ordered them to take the sandboard again, but they became
so confused that they were obliged to begin again three times from the
beginning. “What do you discover?” said the King angrily. “O our master,”
replied they, “he whom we seek has been carried away by a beast of the desert,
which is flying with him between Heaven and earth.” “How is this?” said the
King to Alka; “have you ever seen anything like it?” He seized his sword in
a rage, and three fled, and he killed four of the others. When Alka went
home, she released Saif, and told him what had happened. Next morning Alka
took the gazelle, and slaughtered it in a copper kettle. She then took a golden
mortar, and reversed it over it, and said to Saif Zul Yezn, “Sit on this
mortar till I come back.” She then went to the divan, and chose out six wise
men, who again took the sandboard, and began again three times over in
confusion. “Alas,” said the King, in anger, “What misfortune do you perceive?”
“O our master,” they exclaimed in consternation, “our understanding
is confused, for we see him sitting on a golden mountain, which is in the midst
of a sea of blood, surrounded by a copper wall.” The King was enraged, and
broke up the assembly, saying, “O Alka, I will now depend on you alone.”
“To-morrow I will attempt to show you the stranger,” she replied. When she
came home, she related to Saif what had happened and said, “I shall know by
to-morrow what to tell the King to engage his attention, and prevent him from
pursuing you.” Next morning she found Taka speaking to Saif Zul Yezn alone;
and she asked her, “What does he wish?” “Mother,” replied Taka, “he
wishes to go to the King’s palace, to see him and the divan.” “What you wish
shall be done,” said she to Saif, “but you must not speak.” He assented to the
condition, and she dressed him as her attendant, gave him a sandboard, and went
with him to the King, who said to her, “I could not sleep at all last night, for
thinking of the stranger for whom we are seeking.” “Now that the affair is in
my hands,” returned she, “you will find me a sufficient protection against him.”
She immediately ordered Saif to give her the sandboard. She took it, and when
she had made her calculations, she said joyfully to the King, “O my lord, I can
give you the welcome news of the flight of the stranger, owing to his dread of you
and your revenge.” When the King heard this, he rent his clothes, slapped his
face, and said, “He would not have departed, without having taken the book.”
“I cannot see if he has taken anything,” replied she. “This is the first of the
month,” said the King, “come and let us see if it is missing.” He then went
with a large company to the building where the book was kept. Alka turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>away from the King for a moment to say to Saif, “Do not enter with us, for if
you enter, the case will open of itself, and the book will fall into your hands.
This would at once betray you, and you would be seized and put to death, and
all my labour would have been in vain.” She then left him, and rejoined the
King. When they reached the building, the doors were opened, and when the
King entered, they found the book. They immediately paid it the customary
honours, and protracted this species of worship, while Saif stood at the door,
debating with himself whether to enter or not. At last his impatience overcame
him, and he entered, and at the same instant the casket was broken to pieces,
and the book fell out. The King then ordered all to stand up, and the book
rolled to Saif Zul Yezn. Upon this all drew their swords, and rushed upon him.
Saif drew his sword also, and cried “God is great!” as Shaikh Gyat had taught
him. He continued to fight and defend himself, and struggled to reach the
door. The entire town arose in tumult to pursue him, when he stumbled over
a dead body, and was seized. “Let me not see his face,” cried the King, “but
throw him into the mine.” This mine was eighty yards deep, and had not been
opened for sixty years. It was closed by a heavy leaden cover, which they
replaced, after they had loaded him with chains, and thrown him in. Saif sat
there in the darkness, greatly troubled, and lamenting his condition to Him who
never sleeps. Suddenly, a side wall of the mine opened, and a figure came
forth which approached and called him by his name. “Who are you?” asked
Saif. “I am a woman named Akissa, and inhabit the mountain where the Nile
rises. We are a nation who hold the faith of Abraham. A very pious man
lives below us in a beautiful palace. But an evil Jinni named Mukhtatif lived
near us also, who loved me, and demanded me in marriage of my father. He
consented from fear, but I was unwilling to marry an evil being who was a
worshipper of fire. ‘How can you promise me in marriage to an infidel?’
said I to my father. ‘I shall thereby escape his malice myself,’ replied he. I
went out and wept, and complained to the pious man about the affair. ‘Do you
know who will kill him?’ said he to me, and I answered, ‘No.’ ‘I will direct
you to him who has cut off his hand,’ said he. ‘His name is Saif Zul Yezn, and
he is now in the city of King Kamrun, in the mine.’ Thereupon he brought
me to you, and I come as you see me, to guide you to my country, that you may
kill Mukhtatif, and free the earth from his wickedness.” She then moved him,
and shook him, and all his chains fell off. She lifted him on her shoulders, and
carried him to the palace of the Shaikh, who was named Abbas Salam. Here
he heard a voice crying, “Enter, Saif Zul Yezn.” He did so, and found a grave
and venerable old man, who gave him a very friendly reception; saying, “Wait
till to-morrow, when Akissa will come to guide you to the castle of Mukhtatif.”
He remained with him for the night, and when Akissa arrived next morning,
the old man told her to hasten, that the world might be soon rid of the monster.
They then left this venerable man, and when they had walked awhile, Akissa
said to Saif, “Look before you.” He did so, and perceived a black mass
at some distance. “This is the castle of the evil-doer,” said she, “but I cannot
advance a step further than this.” Saif therefore pursued his way alone, and
when he came near the castle, he walked round it to look for the entrance. As
he was noticing the extraordinary height of the castle, which was founded on
the earth, but appeared to overtop the clouds, he saw a window open, and
several people looked out, who pointed at him with their fingers, exclaiming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>“That is he, that is he!” They threw him a rope, which they directed him to
bind round him. They drew him up by it, when he found himself in the
presence of three hundred and sixty damsels, who saluted him by his name.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>SCOTT’S MSS. AND TRANSLATIONS.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>In 1800, Jonathan Scott, LL.D., published a volume of “Tales, Anecdotes,
and Letters, translated from the Arabic and Persian,” based upon a fragmentary
MS., procured by J. Anderson in Bengal, which included the commencement of
the work (Nos. 1–3) in 29 Nights; two tales not divided into Nights (Nos. 264
and 135) and No. 21.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scott’s work includes these two new tales (since republished by Kirby and
Clouston), with the addition of various anecdotes, &amp;c. derived from other
sources. The “Story of the Labourer and the Chair” has points of resemblance
to that of “Malek and the Princess Chirine” (Shirin?) in the Thousand and
One Days; and also to that of “Tuhfet El Culoub” (No. 183a) in the Breslau
Edition. The additional tales in this MS. and vol. of translations are marked
“A” under Scott in our Tables. Scott published the following specimens (text
and translation) in Ouseley’s Oriental Collections (1797 and following years)
No. 135m (i. pp. 245–257) and Introduction (ii. pp. 160–172; 228–257).
The contents are fully given in Ouseley, vol. ii. pp. 34, 35.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scott afterwards acquired an approximately complete MS. in 7 vols., written
in 1764, which was brought from Turkey by E. Wortley Montague. Scott
published a table of contents (Ouseley, ii. pp. 25–34), in which, however, the
titles of some few of the shorter tales, which he afterwards translated from it,
are omitted, while the titles of others are differently translated. Thus “Greece”
of the Table becomes “Yemen” in the translation; and “labourer” becomes
“sharper.” As a specimen, he subsequently printed the text and translation
of No. 145 (Ouseley, ii. pp. 349–367).</p>

<p class='c000'>This MS., which differs very much from all others known, is now in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1811, Scott published an edition of the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments, in
6 vols., vol. 1 containing a long introduction, and vol. 6, including a series of new
tales from the Oxford MS. (There is a small paper edition; and also a large paper
edition, the latter with frontispieces). It had originally been Scott’s intention to
retranslate the MS.; but he appears to have found it beyond his powers. He
therefore contented himself with re-editing Galland, altering little except the
spelling of the names, and saying that Galland’s version is in the main so
correct that it would be useless repetition to go over the work afresh. Although
he says that he found many of the tales both immoral and puerile, he translated
most of those near the beginning, and omitted much more (including several
harmless and interesting tales, such as No. 152) towards the end of his MS.
than near the beginning. The greater part of Scott’s additional tales, published
in vol. 6, are included in the composite French and German editions of Gauttier
and Habicht; but, except Nos. 208, 209, and 215, republished in my “New
Arabian Nights,” they have not been reprinted in England, being omitted in
all the many popular versions which are professedly based upon Scott, even in
the edition in 4 vols., published in 1882, which reprints Scott’s Preface.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>The edition of 1882 was published about the same time as one of the latest
re-issues of Lane’s Thousand and One Nights; and the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> of
Nov. 4, 1882 (p. 609) published an article on the Arabian Nights, containing the
following amusing passage: “Then Jonathan Scott, LL.D. Oxon, assures the
world that he intended to retranslate the tales given by Galland; but he found
Galland so adequate on the whole that he gave up the idea, and now reprints
Galland, with etchings by M. Lalauze, giving a French view of Arab life. Why
Jonathan Scott, LL.D., should have thought to better Galland, while Mr. Lane’s
version is in existence, and has just been reprinted, it is impossible to say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The most interesting of Scott’s additional tales, with reference to ordinary
editions of The Nights, are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 204b is a variant of No. 37.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 204c is a variant of 3c, in which the wife, instead of the husband, acts
the part of a jealous tyrant. (Compare Cazotte’s story of Halechalbe).</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 204e. Here we have a reference to the Nesnás, which only appears once
in the ordinary versions of The Nights (No. 132b; Burton, v., p. 333).</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 206b is a variant of No. 156.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 207c. This relates to a bird similar to that in the Jealous Sisters (No.
198), and includes a variant of 3ba.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 207h. Another story of enchanted birds. The prince who seeks them
encounters an “Oone” under similar circumstances to those under which
Princess Parizade (No. 198) encounters the old durwesh. The description is
hardly that of a Marid, with which I imagine the Ons are wrongly identified.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 208 contains the nucleus of the famous story of Aladdin (No. 193.)</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 209 is similar to No. 162; but we have again the well incident of No.
3ba, and the exposure of the children as in No. 198.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 215. Very similar to Hasan of Bassorah (No. 155). As Sir R. F.
Burton (vol. viii. p. 60, note), has called in question my identification of the
Islands of Wák-Wák, with the Aru Islands near New Guinea, I will quote here
the passages from Mr. A. R. Wallace’s Malay Archipelago (chap. 31) on which I
based it:—“The trees frequented by the birds are very lofty.... One day
I got under a tree where a number of the Great Paradise birds were assembled,
but they were high up in the thickest of the foliage, and flying and jumping about
so continually that I could get no good view of them.... Their voice is
most extraordinary. At early morn, before the sun has risen, we hear a loud
cry of ‘Wawk—wawk—wawk, wŏk—wŏk—wŏk,’ which resounds through the
forest, changing its direction continually. This is the Great Bird of Paradise
going to seek his breakfast.... The birds had now commenced what the
people here call their ‘sacaleli,’ or dancing-parties, in certain trees in the forest,
which are not fruit-trees as I at first imagined, but which have an immense head
of spreading branches and large but scattered leaves, giving a clear space for
the birds to play and exhibit their plumes. On one of these trees a dozen or
twenty full-plumaged male birds assemble together, raise up their wings, stretch
out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in a continual
vibration. Between whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great
excitement, so that the whole tree is filled with waving plumes in every variety
of attitude and motion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 216bc appears to be nearly the same as No. 42.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 225 is a variant of No. 135q.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><em>WEIL’S TRANSLATION.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The only approximately complete original German translation is “<span lang="de">Tausend
und eine Nacht. Arabische Erzählungen. Zum Erstenmale aus dem Urtexte
vollständig und treu übersetzt von Dr. Gustav Weil</span>,” four vols., Stuttgart. The
first edition was in roy. 8vo, and was published at Stuttgart and Pforzheim in 1839–1842;
the last volume I have not seen; it is wanting in the copy in the British
Museum. This edition is divided into Nights, and includes No. 25b. In the later
editions, which are in small square 8vo, but profusely illustrated, like the larger
one, this story is omitted (except No. 135m, which the French editors include with
it), though Galland’s doubtful stories are retained; and there is no division into
Nights. The work has been reprinted several times, and the edition quoted in
our Table is described as “<span lang="de">Zweiter Abdruck der dritten vollstandig umgearbeiteten,
mit Anmerkungen und mit einer Einleitung versehenen Auflage</span>”
(1872).</p>

<p class='c000'>Weil has not stated from what sources he drew his work, except that No.
201 is taken from a MS. in the Ducal Library at Gotha. This is unfortunate, as
his version of the great transformation scene in No. 3b (Burton, vol. i. pp. 134,
135), agrees more closely with Galland than with any other original version.
In other passages, as when speaking of the punishment of Aziz (No. 9a, aa),
Weil seems to have borrowed an expression from Lane, who writes “a cruel
wound;” Weil saying “a severe (<span lang="de">schwere</span>) wound.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereas Weil gives the only German version known to me of No. 9 (though
considerably abridged) he omits many tales contained in Zinserling and
Habicht, but whether because his own work was already too bulky, or because
his original MSS. did not contain them, I do not know; probably the first
supposition is correct, for in any case it was open to him to have translated them
from the printed texts, to which he refers in his Preface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two important stories (Nos. 200 and 201) are not found in any other
version; but as they are translated in my “New Arabian Nights,” I need not
discuss them here. I will, however, quote a passage from the story of Judar
and Mahmood, which I omitted because it is not required by the context,
and because I thought it a little out of place in a book published in a juvenile
series. It is interesting from its analogy to the story of Semele.</p>

<p class='c000'>When King Kashuk (a jinni) is about to marry the daughter of King
Shamkoor, we read (New Arabian Nights, p. 182), “Shamkoor immediately
summoned my father, and said, ‘Take my daughter, for you have won her
heart.’ He immediately provided an outfit for his daughter, and when it was
completed, my father and his bride rode away on horseback, while the trousseau
of the Princess followed on three hundred camels.” The passage proceeds (the
narrator being Daruma, the offspring of the marriage), “When my father had
returned home, and was desirous of celebrating his marriage (his Wazir) Kandarin
said to him, ‘Your wife will be destroyed if you touch her, for you are created
of fire, and she is created of earth, which the fire devours. You will then bewail
her death when it is too late. To-morrow,’ continued he, ‘I will bring you an
ointment with which you must rub both her and yourself; and you may then
live long and happily together.’ On the following day he brought him a white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>ointment, and my father anointed himself and his bride with it, and consummated
his marriage without danger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I may add that this is the only omission of the smallest consequence in my
rendering of either story.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard from more than one source that a complete German translation
of The Nights was published, and suppressed; but I have not been able to
discover the name of the author, the date, or any other particulars relating to
the subject.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>VON HAMMER’S MS., AND THE TRANSLATIONS DERIVED FROM IT.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>Several complete copies of The Nights were obtained by Europeans about the
close of the last or the beginning of the present century; and one of these
(in 4 vols.) fell into the hands of the great German Orientalist, Joseph von
Hammer. This MS. agrees closely with the printed Bul. and Mac. texts, as
well as with Dr. Clarke’s MS., though the names of the tales sometimes vary
a little. One story, “The two Wazirs,” given in Von Hammer’s list as inedited,
no doubt by an oversight, is evidently No. 7, which bears a similar title in
Torrens. One title, “Al Kavi,” a story which Von Hammer says was published
in “Mag. Encycl.,” and in English (probably by Scott in Ouseley’s Oriental
Collections, <span lang="la">vide anteà</span> p. 491) puzzled me for some time; but from its position,
and the title I think I have identified it as No. 145, and have entered it as such.
No. 9a in this as well as in several other MSS., bears the title of the Two Lovers,
or of the Lover and the Beloved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Von Hammer made a French translation of the unpublished tales, which he
lent to Caussin de Perceval, who extracted from it four tales only (Nos. 21a, 22,
32 and 37), and only acknowledged his obligations in a general way to a distinguished
Orientalist, whose name he pointedly suppressed. Von Hammer,
naturally indignant, reclaimed his MS., and had it translated into German by
Zinserling. He then sent the French MS. to De Sacy, in whose hands it
remained for some time, although he does not appear to have made any use of
it, when it was despatched to England for publication; but the courier lost it on
the journey, and it was never recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zinserling’s translation was published under the title, “Der Tausend und
einen Nacht noch nicht übersetzte Mährchen, Erzählungen und Anekdoten,
zum erstenmale aus dem Arabischen in’s Französische übersetzt von Joseph von
Hammer, und aus dem Französischen in’s Deutsche von Aug. E. Zinserling,
Professor.” (3 vols., Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1823.) The introductory matter is
of considerable importance, and includes notices of 12 different MSS., and a
list of contents of Von Hammer’s MS. The tales begin with No. 23, Nos. 9–19
being omitted, because Von Hammer was informed that they were about to be
published in France. (This possibly refers to Asselan Riche’s “Scharkan,”
published in 1829.) The tales and anecdotes in this edition follow the order of
The Nights. No. 163 is incomplete, Zinserling giving only the commencement;
and two other tales (Nos. 132b and 168) are related in such a confused manner
as to be unintelligible, the former from transposition (perhaps in the sheets
of the original MS.) and the latter from errors and omissions. On the other
hand, some of the tales (No. 137 for instance) are comparatively full and
accurate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>A selection from the longer tales was published in English in 3 vols. in
1826, under the title of “New Arabian Nights Entertainments, selected from
the original Oriental MS. by Jos. von Hammer, and now first translated into
English by the Rev. George Lamb.” I have only to remark that No. 132b is
here detached from its connection with No. 132, and is given an independent
existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A complete French re-translation of Zinserling’s work, also in 3 vols., by
G. S. Trébutien (<span lang="fr">Contes inédits des Mille et une Nuits</span>) was published in Paris
in 1828; but in this edition the long tales are placed first, and all the anecdotes
are placed together last.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>TRANSLATIONS OF THE PRINTED TEXTS.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>These are noticed by Sir R. F. Burton in his “Foreword” (vol. 1, pp. xi.-xiii.)
and consequently can be passed over with a brief mention here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Torrens’ edition (vol. 1) extends to the end of Night 50 (Burton, in p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Lane’s translation originally appeared in monthly half-crown parts, from
1839 to 1841. It is obvious that he felt himself terribly restricted in space;
for the third volume, although much thicker than the others, is not only almost
destitute of notes towards the end, but the author is compelled to grasp at every
excuse to omit tales, even excluding No. 168, which he himself considered “one
of the most entertaining tales in the work,” (chap. xxix., note 12) on account of
its resemblance to Nos. 1b and 3d. Part of the matter in Lane’s own earlier
notes is apparently derived from No. 132a, which he probably did not at first
intend to omit. Sir R. F. Burton has taken 5 vols. to cover the same ground
which Lane has squeezed into his vol. 3. But it is only fair to Lane to remark
that in such cases the publisher is usually far more to blame than the author.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1847 appeared a popular edition of Lane, entitled, “The Thousand and
One Nights, or the Arabian Nights Entertainments, translated and arranged for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>family reading, with explanatory notes. Second edition.” Here Galland’s old
spelling is restored, and the “explanatory notes,” ostentatiously mentioned on
the title page are entirely omitted. This edition was in 3 vols. I have seen a
copy dated 1850; and think I have heard of an issue in 1 vol.; and there is an
American reprint in 2 vols. The English issue was ultimately withdrawn from
circulation in consequence of Lane’s protests. (Mr. S. L. Poole’s Life of
E. W. Lane, p. 95). It contains the woodcut of the Flying Couch, which is
wanting in the later editions of the genuine work; but not Galland’s doubtful
tales, as Poole asserts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several editions of the original work, edited by Messrs. E. S. and S. L.
Poole, have appeared at intervals from 1859 to 1882. They differ little from
the original edition except in their slightly smaller size.</p>

<p class='c000'>The short tales included in Lane’s notes were published separately as one of
Knight’s Weekly Volumes, in 1845, under the title of “Arabian Tales and
Anecdotes, being a selection from the notes to the new translation of the
Thousand and One Nights, by E. W. Lane, Esq.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, in 1883, Mr. Stanley Lane Poole published a classified and
arranged edition of Lane’s notes under the title of “Arabian Society in the
Middle Ages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. John Payne’s version of the Mac. edition was issued in 9 vols. by the
Villon Society to subscribers only. It appeared from 1882 to 1884, and only
500 copies were printed. Judging from the original prospectus, it seems to
have been the author’s intention to have completed the work in 8 vols., and to
have devoted vol. 9 to Galland’s doubtful tales; but as they are omitted, he
must have found that the work ran to a greater length than he had anticipated,
and that space failed him. He published some preliminary papers on the
Nights in the New Quarterly Magazine for January and April, 1879.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Payne subsequently issued “Tales from the Arabic of the Breslau and
Calcutta (1814–18) editions of the Thousand Nights and One Night, not
occurring in the other printed texts of the work.” (Three vols., London, 1884).
Of this work, issued, like the other, by the Villon Society, to subscribers only,
750 copies were printed, besides 50 on large paper. The third volume includes
indices of all the tales in the four principal printed texts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally we have Sir R. F. Burton’s translation now in its entirety before his
subscribers. It is restricted to 1,000 copies. (Why not 1,001?) The five
supplementary vols. are to include tales wanting in the Mac. edition, but found
in other texts (printed and MS.), while Lady Burton’s popular edition will allow
of the free circulation of Sir R. F. Burton’s work among all classes of the reading
public.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>COLLECTIONS OF SELECTED TALES.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>There are many volumes of selections derived from Galland, but these hardly
require mention; the following may be noticed as derived from other sources:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Caliphs and Sultans, being tales omitted in the usual editions of the Arabian
Nights’ Entertainments. Re-written and re-arranged by Sylvanus Hanley,
F.L.S., etc., London, 1868; 2nd edition 1870.</p>

<p class='c000'>Consists of portions of tales chiefly selected from Scott, Lamb, Chavis and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>Cazotte, Trébutien and Lane; much abridged, and frequently strung together, as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Nos. 246, 41, 32 (including Nos. 111, 21a, and 89); 9a (including 9aa, [which
Hanley seems, by the way, to have borrowed from some version which I do not
recognise] 22 and 248); 155, 156, 136, 162; Xailonn the Silly (from Cazotte); 132
and 132a; and 169 (including 134 and 135x).</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Ilâm-en-Nâs. Historical tales and anecdotes of the time of the early
Kalîfahs. Translated from the Arabic and annotated by Mrs. Godfrey Clerk,
author of “The Antipodes, and Round the World.” London, 1873.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of these anecdotes, as is candidly admitted by the authoress in her
Preface, are found with variations in the Nights, though not translated by
her from this source.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The New Arabian Nights. Select tales not included by Galland or
Lane. By W. F. Kirby, London, 1882.</p>

<p class='c000'>Includes the following tales, slightly abridged, from Weil and Scott: Nos.
200, 201, 264, 215, 209, and 208.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two editions have appeared in England, besides reprints in America and
Australia.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>SEPARATE EDITIONS OF SINGLE OR COMPOSITE TALES.</em></h3>

<h4 class='c019'>6 e (ee).—<span class='sc'>The Barber’s Fifth Brother.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Mr. W. R. Clouston (in litt.) calls attention to the version of this story by
Addison in the “Spectator,” No. 535, Nov. 13, 1712, after Galland. There is
good reason to suppose that this is subsequent to the first English edition, which,
however, Addison does not mention. There is also an English version in Faris’
little Arabic Grammar (London, 1856), and likewise in Richardson’s Arabic
Grammar. The latter author extracted it from a MS. belonging to Sir W.
Jones.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>5.—<span class='sc'>Nur Al-Din and Badr Al-Din Hasan.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There are two Paris editions of the “<span lang="fr">Histoire de Chems-Eddine et de
Nour-Eddine</span>,” edited by Prof. Cherbonneau. The first (1852) contains text and
notes, and the second (1869) includes text, vocabulary and translations.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>7.—<span class='sc'>Nur Al Din and Anis Al-Jalis.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>An edition by Kasíwirski of “<span lang="fr">Enis’ el-Djelis, ou histoire de la belle Persane</span>,”
appeared in Paris in 1867. It includes text, translation and notes.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>9.—<span class='sc'>King Omar Bin Al-Nu’aman.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There is a French abridgment of this story entitled, “<span lang="fr">Scharkan, Conte
Arabe, suivi de quelques anecdotes orientales; traduit par M. Asselan Riche,
Membre de la Société Asiatique de Paris</span>” (Paris and Marseilles, 12mo, 1829,
pp. 240). The seven anecdotes appended are as follows: (1) the well-known
story of Omar’s prisoner and the glass of water; (2) Elhedjadj and a young
Arab; (3) = our No. 140; (4) Anecdote of Elhedjadj and a story-teller; (5) =
our No. 86; (6) King Bahman and the Moubed’s parable of the Owls; (7) = our
No. 145.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>133.—<span class='sc'>Sindbad the Seaman.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This is the proper place to call attention to a work specially relating to this
story, “Remarks on the Arabian Nights Entertainments; in which the origin of
Sindbad’s Voyages and other Oriental Fictions is particularly described. By
Richard Hole, LL.D.” (London, 1797, pp. iv. 259).</p>

<p class='c000'>It is an old book, but may still be consulted with advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two important critical editions of No. 133, one in French and one
in German.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="fr">1. Les Voyages de Sind-bâd le marin et la ruse des Femmes. Contes arabes.
Traduction littérale, accompagnée du Texte et des Notes. Par L. Langlès
(Paris, 1814).</span></p>

<p class='c000'>The second story is our No. 184.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <span lang="de">Die beiden Sindbad oder Reiseabenteuer Sindbads des Seefabrers. Nach
einer zum ersten Male in Europa bedruckten Ægyptischen Handschrift
unmittelbar und wörtlich treu aus den Arabischen übersetzt und mit erklärenden

Orientalisten herausgegeben von J. G. H. Reinsch (Breslau, 1826).</span></p>

<h4 class='c019'>135.—<span class='sc'>The Craft and Malice of Women.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The literature of this cluster of tales would require a volume in itself, and I
cannot do better than refer to Mr. W. A. Clouston’s “Book of Sindibad” (8vo,
Glasgow, 1884) for further information. This book, though privately printed
and limited to 300 copies, is not uncommon.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>136.—<span class='sc'>Judar and his Brethren.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>An edition of this story, entitled “<span lang="fr">Histoire de Djouder le Pêcheur</span>,” edited
by Prof. Houdas, was published in the <span lang="fr">Bibliothèque Algérienne</span>, at Algiers, in
1865. It includes text and vocabulary.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>174.—<span class='sc'>The Ten Vazirs.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This collection of tales has also been frequently reprinted separately. It is
the Arabic version of the Persian Bakhtyar Nameh, of which Mr. Clouston
issued a privately-printed edition in 1883.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following versions have come under my notice:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="fr">1. Nouveaux Contes Arabes, ou Supplement aux Mille et une Nuits suivies
de Mélanges de Littérature orientale et de lettres, par l’Abbe *** (Paris, 1788,
pp. 425).</span></p>

<p class='c000'>This work consists chiefly of a series of tales selected and adapted from the
Ten Vazirs. “Written in Europe by a European, and its interest is found in
the Terminal Essay, on the Mythologia Æsopica” (Burton in litt.).</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="de">2. Historien om de ti Vezirer og hoorledes det gik dem med Kong Azád
Bachts Sön, oversat af Arabisk ved R. Rask (8vo, Kobenhavn, 1829).</span></p>

<p class='c000'>3. Habicht, x. p. vi., refers to the following;—<span lang="la">Historia decem Vezirorum
et filii regis Azad-Bacht insertis XIII. aliis narrationibus, in usum tironum
Cahirensem, edid. G. Knös, Göttingen, 1807, 8vo.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>He also states that Knös published the commencement in 1805, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>“<span lang="la">Disquisitio de fide Herodoti, quo perhibet Phœnices Africam navibus circumvectos

<p class='c000'>Chavis and Cazotte (pp. 471, 472) included a version of the Ten
Vazirs in their work; and others are referred to in our Table of Tales.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>248.—<span class='sc'>The Wise Heycar.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Subsequently to the publication of Gauttier’s edition of The Nights, Agoub
republished his translation under the title of “<span lang="fr">Le sage Heycar, conte Arabe</span>”
(Paris, 1824).</p>

<hr class='c040' >

<p class='c000'>A few tales published by Scott in Ouseley’s Oriental Collections have already
been noticed (<span lang="la">anteà</span>, p. 491).</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>TRANSLATIONS OF COGNATE ORIENTAL ROMANCES ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE NIGHTS.</em></h3>
<h4 class='c019'>1 <span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Les Mille et un Jours. Contes Persanes.</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>“In imitation of the Arabian Nights, was composed a Persian collection
entitled ‘Hazár Yek Rúz (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">روز يک رور</span>)<a id='t499'></a> or the Thousand and One Days,’ of
which Petis de la Croix published a French rendering [in 1710], which was
done into English [by Dr. King, and published in 2 vols. (with the Turkish
Tales = Forty Vezirs) as early as 1714; and subsequently] by Ambrose Phillips”
(in 1738), (Clouston, in litt.). Here, and occasionally elsewhere, I have quoted
from some MSS. notes on The Nights by Mr. W. A. Clouston, which Sir R. F.
Burton kindly permitted me to inspect. Mr. Clouston then quotes Cazotte’s
Preface (not in my edition of the Thousand and One Days), according to which
the book was written by the celebrated Dervis Moclès (Mukhlis) chief of the
Sofis (Sufis?) of Ispahan, founded upon certain Indian comedies. Petis de la
Croix was on friendly terms with Mukhlis, who allowed him to take a copy
of his work in 1675, during his residence in Ispahan. (I find these statements
confirmed in the <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, xxxvii. pp. 266, 274, 278, and in
Weber’s “Tales of the East,” i. pp. xxxvi., xxxxii.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The framework of the story is the same as Nos. 9a and 152: a Princess,
who conceives an aversion to men from dreaming of the self-devotion of a
doe, and the indifference and selfishness of a stag. Mr. Clouston refers to
Nakhshabí’s Tútí Náma (No. 33 of Káderí’s abridgment, and 39 of India
Office MS. 2,573); whence he thinks it probable that Mukhlis may have taken
the tale. But the tale itself is repeated over and over again in many
Arabic, Persian, and Turkish collections: in fact, there are few of commoner
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tales are told by the nurse in order to overcome the aversion of the
Princess to men. They are as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>Introduction and Conclusion: Story of the Princess of Cashmir.</p>

<p class='c034'>1. Story of Aboulcassem Bafry.</p>

<p class='c041'>7. Story of Nasiraddolé, King of Moussel, of Abderrahman, Merchant of

<p class='c041'>8. Story of Repsima.</p>

<p class='c000'>This work has many times been reprinted in France, where it holds a place
only second to The Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir R. F. Burton remarks, concerning the Persian and Turkish Tales of
Petis de la Crois (the latter of which form part of the Forty Vazirs, No. 251.)
“Both are weak and servile imitations of Galland by an Orientalist who knew
nothing of the East. In one passage in the story of Fadlallah, we read of
‘<span lang="fr">Le Sacrifice du Mont Arafáte</span>,’ which seems to have become a fixture in the
European brain. I found the work easy writing and exceedingly hard reading.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The following tales require a passing notice:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <cite>Story of Aboulcassem Bafry.</cite>—A story of concealed treasure; it has
also some resemblance to No. 31.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <cite>Ruzvanchad and Cheheristani.</cite>—Cheheristani is a jinniyah, who is pursued
by the King, under the form of a white doe; marries him, and becomes
the mother of Balkis, the Queen of Sheba. She exacts a promise from him
never to rebuke her for any of her actions: he breaks it, and she leaves him
for a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>2a. <cite>The Young King of Thibet.</cite>—Two imposters obtain magic rings by
which they can assume the shapes of other persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>2a, b. <cite>The Vazir Cavercha.</cite>—This is one of Scott’s stories (No. 223 of our
Table). It goes back at least as far as the Ring of Polycrates. It is the 8th
Vezir’s Story in Mr. Gibbs’ Forty Vezirs (pp. 200–205.)</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <cite>Prince Calaf.</cite>—This story is well known, and is sometimes played as
a comedy. The Princess Turandot puts riddles to her suitors, and beheads
them if they fail to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>5b. <cite>Story of Prince Seyf-el-Molouk.</cite>—This story is perhaps an older
version than that which appears in The Nights (No. 154a.) It is placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>long after the time of Solomon; Saad is devoured by ants; and when Seyf
enters the palace of Malika (= Daulet Khatoon), the jinni surprises them,
and is overpowered by Seyf’s ring. He then informs him of the death of
Saad; and that Bedy al-Jemal was one of the mistresses of Solomon; and
has also long been dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>5b. <cite>Malek and Chirine.</cite>—Resembles No. 264; Malek passes himself off
as the Prophet Mohammed; burns his box (not chair) with fireworks on his
wedding-day, and is thus prevented from ever returning to the Princess.</p>

<p class='c000'>5f. <cite>Adventures of Aboulfawaris.</cite>—Romantic travels, resembling Nos.
132a and 133.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <cite>Antar.</cite>—This is the most famous of the Badawi romances. It resembles
No. 137, in several particulars, but is destitute of supernaturalism. An English
abridgment in 4 vols. was published in 1820; and the substance of vol. 1 had
appeared, as a fragment, in the previous year, under the title of “Antar, a
Bedoueen Romance translated from the Arabic by Terrick Hamilton, Esq.,
Oriental Secretary to the British Embassy at Constantinople.” I have also
seen vol. 1 of a French translation, published about 1862, and extending to
the death of Shas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lane (Modern Egyptians, ch. 21–23) describes several other Arab
romances, which have not yet been translated; viz. Aboo-Zeyd; Ez-Zahir,
and Delhemeh.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Glaive-des-Couronnes</span></span> (Seif el-Tidjân) <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">التچان التچبان</span><a id='t501'></a> <span lang="fr">Roman traduit de
l’Arabe. Par M. le Dr. Perron (Paris, 1862).</span></p>

<p class='c000'>A romantic story of Arab chivalry, less overloaded with supernaturalism
than No. 137; but more supernatural than Antar. The hero marries (among
other wives) two jinniyahs of the posterity of Iblis. In ch. 21 we have an
account of a magical city much resembling the City of Brass (No. 134) and
defended by similar talismans.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <span class='sc'>Mehemet the Kurd</span>, and other tales, from Eastern sources, by Charles
Wells, Turkish Prizeman of King’s College, London, and Member of the Royal
Asiatic Society (London, 1865).</p>

<p class='c000'>The first story, taken from an Arabic MS., is a narrative of a handsome
simple-minded man, with whom Princesses fall in love, and who is raised to
a mighty throne by their enchantments. Some of the early incidents are not
unlike those in the well-known German story of Lucky Hans (Hans im Glück).
In one place there is an enchanted garden, where Princesses disport themselves
in feather-dresses (as in No. 155, &amp;c.), and where magic apples grow.
(Note that apples are always held in extraordinary estimation in The Nights,
cf. Nos. 4 and 264). Among the shorter stories we find No. 251h; a version
of Nos. 9a and 152 (probably that referred to by Mr. Clouston as in the Tuti
Nama); a story “The Prince Tailor,” resembling No. 251; No. 256, and one
or two other tales not connected with The Nights. (Most of Wells’ shorter
tales are evidently taken from the Forty Vezirs.)</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <span lang="fr"><span class='sc'>Recueil des Contes Populaires</span> de la Kabylie du Djardjara, recueillis
et traduits par J. Rivière (Paris, 1882).</span> I have not seen this book; but it
can hardly fail to illustrate The Nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. <span class='sc'>The Story of Jewad</span>, a Romance by ’Alī ’Azīz Efendi the Cretan.
Translated from the Turkish by E. J. W. Gibb, M.R.A.S., &amp;c. (Glasgow, 1884).</p>

<p class='c000'>A modern Turkish work, written in A.H. 1211 (1796–7). It contains the
following tales:—</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>
  <h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>The Story of Jewad.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>1. The Story of Ebū-’Alī-Sīnā.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The Story of Monia Emīn.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The Story of Ferah-Nāz, the daughter of the King of China.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>a.</i> The Story of Khoja ’Abdu-llah.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The Story told by Jewād to Iklilu’l Mulk.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>a.</i> The Story of Shābūr and Humā.</p>

<p class='c034'><i>c.</i> The Story of Ghazanfer and Rāhila.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The Story of Qara Khan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following deserve notice from our present point of view:—</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Story of Jewād.</cite>—Here we have magical illusions, as in Nos. 247 and
251a. Such narratives are common in the East; Lane, (Nights, ch. i. note 15)
is inclined to attribute such illusions to the influence of drugs; but the narratives
seem rather to point to so-called electro-biology, or the Scotch Glamour,
(such influences, as is notorious, acting far more strongly upon Orientals than
upon Europeans).</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <cite>The Story of Monia Emīn</cite> corresponds to the Story of Naerdan and
Guzulbec, in Caylus’ Oriental Tales. A story of magical illusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <cite>The Story of Ferah Nāz.</cite>—Here again we have a variant of Nos. 9a
and 152.</p>

<p class='c000'>3a. <cite>Khoja ’Abdu-ltab.</cite>—This is a version of the Story of Aboulcassem in
the Thousand and One Days.</p>

<p class='c000'>4a. <cite>Shābūr and Humā.</cite>—The commencement of this story might have
suggested to Southey the adventures of Thalaba and Oneida in the Gardens
of Aloadin; the remainder appears to be taken from the Story of the young
King of Thibet, in the Thousand and One Days.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <cite>Qara Khan.</cite>—The principal part of this story is borrowed from the
First Voyage of Aboulfawaris in the Thousand and One Days; it has some
resemblance to the story of the Mountain of Loadstone in No. 3c.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <span class='sc'><span lang="de">Früchte des Asiatischen Geist</span></span>, von A. T. Hartmann. 2 vols., 12 mo.
(Münster) 1803. A collection of anecdotes, &amp;c., from various Eastern sources,
Arabic, Indian, &amp;c. I think it not impossible that this may be the work
referred to by Von Hammer in the preface to Zinserling’s “1001 Nacht”
(p. xxvii. note) as “<span lang="de">Asiatische Perlenschnur<a id='t502'></a> von Hartmann</span>.” At least I have
not yet met with any work to which the scanty indication would apply better.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <span class='sc'>Tuti-Nama.</span> I could hardly pass over the famous Persian and Turkish
“Parrot-Book” quite without notice; but its tales have rarely any direct connection
with those in The Nights, and I have not attempted to go into its very
extensive bibliography.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>DR. CLARKE’S MS.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>Dr. Edward Daniel Clarke has given an account of an important MS.
nearly agreeing with Bul. and Mac., which he purchased in Egypt, in his
“Travels in various countries of Europe, Asia and Africa.” Part ii. Greece,
Egypt, and the Holy Land. Section i. (1812) App. iii., pp. 701–704. Unfortunately,
this MS. was afterwards so damaged by water during a shipwreck
that it was rendered totally illegible. The list of tales (as will be seen by the
numbers in brackets, which correspond to our Table, as far as the identifications
are safe) will show the approximate contents of the MS., but the list (which is
translated into German by Habicht in the preface to his vol. 12) was evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>compiled carelessly by a person nearly ignorant of Arabic, perhaps with the aid
of an interpreter, Maltese, or other, and seems to abound with the most absurd
mistakes. The full text of Clarke’s App. iii. is as follows: “List of One Hundred
and Seventy-two Tales, contained in a manuscript copy of The ‘Alif
Lila va Lilin,’ or ‘Arabian Nights,’ as it was procured by the Author in Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>N.B.—The Arabic words mentioned in this list are given as they appeared
to be pronounced in English characters, and of course, therefore, adapted to
English pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of tales amounts to 172, but one tale is supposed to occupy
many nights in the recital, so that the whole number is divided into “<cite>One
Thousand and One Nights</cite>.” It rarely happens that any two copies of the
Alif Lila va Lilin resemble each other. This title is bestowed upon any collection
of Eastern tales divided into the same number of parts. The compilation
depends upon the taste, the caprice, and the opportunities of the scribe, or the
commands of his employer. Certain popular stories are common to almost all
copies of the Arabian Nights, but almost every collection contains some tales
which are not found in every other. Much depends upon the locality of the
scribe. The popular stories of Egypt will be found to differ materially from
those of Constantinople. A nephew of the late Wortley Montague, living in
Rosetta, had a copy of the Arabian Nights, and upon comparing the two manuscripts
it appeared that out of the 172 tales here enumerated only 37 were found
in his manuscript. In order to mark, therefore, the stories which were common
to the two manuscripts, an asterisk has been prefixed to the thirty-seven tales
which appeared in both copies.</p>

<p class='c018'>The success of Galland’s work led to the appearance of numerous works more
or less resembling it, chiefly in England and France. Similar imitations,
though now less numerous, have continued to appear down to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important of the older works of this class were published in
French in the “<span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>” (Amsterdam and Geneva, 1785–1793; 41
vols.); in English in “Tales of the East: comprising the most popular
Romances of Oriental origin, and the best imitations by European authors,
with new translations and additional tales never before published, to which is
prefixed an introductory dissertation, containing an account of each work and
of its author or translator. By Henry Weber, Esq.” (Edinburgh, 1812, 3 vols.);
and in German in “<span lang="de">Tausend und ein Tag. Morgenländische Erzählungen
aus dem Persisch, Turkisch und Arabisch, nach Petis de la Croix, Galland,
Cardonne, Chavis und Cazotte, dem Grafen Caylus, und Anderer. Übersetzt von
F. H. von der Hagen</span>” (Prenzlau, 1827–1837, 11 vols.) In the “<span lang="fr">Cabinet des
Fées</span>” I find a reference to an older collection of tales (partly Oriental) called
the “<span lang="fr">Bibliothèque des Fées et des Génies</span>,” by the Abbé de la Porte, which I
have not seen, but which is, in part, incorporated in the “Cabinet.” It formed
only 2 vols. 12mo, and was published in 1765.</p>

<p class='c000'>The examination of these tales is difficult, for they comprise several classes,
not always clearly defined:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Satires on The Nights themselves (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> the Tales of the Count of
Hamilton.)</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Satires in an Oriental garb (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Beckford’s Vathek).</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Moral tales in an Oriental garb (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Mrs. Sheridan’s Nourjahad).</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Fantastic tales with nothing Oriental about them but the name (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i>
Stevenson’s New Arabian Nights).</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Imitations pure and simple (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> G. Meredith’s Shaving of Shagpat).</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Imitations more or less founded on genuine Oriental sources (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> the Tales
of the Comte de Caylus).</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Genuine Oriental Tales (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> <span lang="fr">Mille et une Jours</span>, translated by Petis de la
Croix).</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the tales belonging to Class 7 and some of those belonging to
Class 6 have been treated of in previous sections. The remaining tales and
imitations will generally need only a very brief notice; sometimes only the
title and the indication of the class to which they belong. We will begin with
an enumeration of the Oriental contents of the <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, adding W.
i. ii. and iii. to show which are included in Weber’s “Tales of the East”:—</p>

<div>

anteà</span> p. <a href='#Page_470'>470</a>; W. i. ii.).</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>(Weber also includes, in his vol. ii. Nos. 21a, 22, 32 and 37, after Caussin de
Perceval.)</p>

<p class='c000'>12, 13. <cite>The Adventures of Abdallah, the Son of Hanif</cite> (Class 5 or 6).</p>

<p class='c000'>Originally published in 1713; attributed to M. de Bignon, a young Abbé. A
series of romantic travels, in which Eastern and Western fiction is mixed; for
instance, we have the story of the Rose-tree, which so far as I know, has
nothing Oriental about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. <cite>The Voyages of Zulma in Fairy Land</cite> (Class 4).</p>

<p class='c000'>European fairy tales, with nothing Oriental about them but the names of
persons and places. The work is unfinished.</p>

<p class='c000'>17, 18. <cite>The Tales of Bidpai</cite> (translated by Galland) are Indian, and therefore
need no further notice here.</p>

<p class='c000'>19–23. <cite>Chinese, Tartarian and Mogul Tales</cite> (Class 6).</p>

<p class='c000'>Published in 1723, and later by Thomas Simon Gueulette.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning these tales, Mr. Clouston remarks (in litt.): “Much of the
groundwork of these clever imitations of the Arabian Nights has been, directly
or indirectly, derived from Eastern sources; for instance, in the so-called
Tartar tales, the adventures of the Young Calender find parallels, (1) in the well-known
Bidpai tale of the Bráhman, the Sharpers and the Goat (Kalila and
Dimna, Pánchatantra, Hitopadesa, &amp;c.) and (2) in the world-wide story of the
Farmer who outwitted the Six Men (Indian Antiquary, vol. 3) of which there are
many versions current in Europe, such as the Norse tale of Big Peter and Little
Peter, the Danish tale of Great Claus and Little Claus; the German tale
(Grimm) of the Little Farmer; the Irish tale of Little Fairy (Samuel Lover’s
collection of Irish Fairy Legends and Stories); four Gaelic versions in
Campbell’s Popular Tales of the West Highlands; a Kaba’il version in Rivière’s
French collection (<span lang="fr">Contes populaires Kabylies</span>); Uncle Capriano in Crane’s
recently published Italian Popular Tales; and a Latin mediæval version
(written probably in the 11th century) in which the hero is called ‘Unibos,’
because he had only one cow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>25. <cite>Oriental Tales</cite> (Class 6).</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Clouston observes, “Appeared in 1749<a id='r472' href='#f472' class='c016'><sup>[472]</sup></a> and on the title page are said
to have been translated from MSS. in the Royal French Library. The stories
are, however, largely the composition of De Caylus himself, and those elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>of them which are traceable to Asiatic sources have been considerably
Frenchified.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless they are not without interest, and are nearly all of obviously
Oriental origin. One of the stories is a fantastic account of the Birth of
Mahomet, including romantic travels largely borrowed from No. 132a. Another
story is a version of that of the Seven Sleepers. Other noteworthy tales are
the story of the Dervish Abounader, which resembles Nos. 193 and 216d.;
and the story of Naerdan and Guzulbec, which is a tale of magical illusions
similar to that of Monia Emin, in the Turkish story of Jewad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count de Caylus was the author of various European as well as Oriental
fairy tales. Of his Oriental collection, Sir R. F. Burton remarks:—“The
stories are not Eastern but Western fairy tales proper, with kings and queens,
giants and dwarfs, and fairies, good and bad. ‘Barbets’ act as body guard
and army. Written in good old style, and free language, such as, for instance,
son pétenlaire, with here and there a touch of salt humour, as in Rosanie
’<span lang="fr">Charmante reine (car on n’a jamais parlé autrement à une reine, quel que
laide qu’elle ait été)</span>.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>29, 30. <cite>Tales of the Genii</cite> (Class 3.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Written in the middle of the last century by Rev. James Ridley, but purporting
to be translated from the Persian of Horam, the son of Asmar, by
Sir Charles Morell.</p>

<p class='c000'>These tales have been reprinted many times; but it is very doubtful if
they are based on any genuine Oriental sources. The amount of Oriental
colouring may be guessed from the story of Urad, who having consented to
become the bride of a Sultan on condition that he should dismiss all his
concubines, and make her his sole queen (like Harald Harfagr on his marriage
with Ragnhilda) is presented to his loving subjects as their Sultána!</p>

<p class='c000'>32. <cite>Adventures of Zeloide and Amanzarifdine.</cite> Indian Tales, by M. de
Moncrif (Class 4.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary European Fairy Tales, with the scene laid in the East.</p>

<p class='c000'>33. <cite>Nourjahad</cite>, by Mrs. Sheridan (Class 3.)</p>

<p class='c000'>An unworthy favourite is reformed by a course of practical moral lessons
conveyed by the Sultan through supposed supernatural agencies. Mr. Clouston
regards it as “one of the very best of the imitations of Eastern fiction. The
plot is ingeniously conceived and well wrought out, and the interest never flags
throughout.”</p>

<p class='c000'>34. <cite>Pajon’s Oriental Tales</cite> (Class 5.). These demand no special notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the above, the following Oriental works are mentioned in the
<span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, but not reprinted:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>This is the same as the Count de Caylus’ Oriental Tales (<span lang="la">vide anteà</span>, p. 508).
Sir R. F. Burton has received the following memorandum, respecting a copy of
an earlier edition of the same work: “<span lang="fr">Contes Orientaux, tirés des manuscrits
de la Bibliothèque du Roy de France, ornés de figures en taille douce. À
la Haye, 1743</span>, 2 vols. 12mo, polished calf gilt, gilt edges, arms in gilt on
the sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Preface says, ‘<span lang="fr">M. Petit et M. Galland n’ont en aucune connaissance
des manuscrits dont cet ouvrage est tiré</span>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Tales are from the MSS. and translations sent by those despatched
by the French Ministers to Constantinople to learn Arabic, &amp;c., and so become
fit to act as Dragomans and Interpreters to the French Embassy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a copy of this work in the British Museum; it proves, as I expected,
to be the series of tales subsequently attributed to the Count de Caylus.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the above, the following, of which I can only give the names,
are mentioned in the <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, but not reprinted:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The remaining imitations, &amp;c., known to me I shall place roughly in chronological
order, premising that I fear the list must be very incomplete, and that I
have met with very few except in English and French.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>A.—<span class='sc'>French.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>1. <span lang="fr"><cite>Zadig, ou la Destinée</cite>, par Voltaire</span><a id='r473' href='#f473' class='c016'><sup>[473]</sup></a> probably partakes of classes 2 and 6;
said to be partly based on Gueulette’s “<span lang="fr">Soirées Bretonnes</span>,” published in 1712.
The latter is included in <span lang="fr">Cabinet des Fées</span>, Vol. 32.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <cite>Vathek, an Arabian Tale</cite>, by William Beckford. I include this book here
because it was written and first published in French. Its popularity was once
very great, and it contains some effective passages, though it belongs to Class 2,
and is rather a parody than an imitation of Oriental fiction. The Caliph Vathek,
after committing many crimes at the instance of his mother, the witch Carathis,
in order to propitiate Eblis, finally starts on an expedition to Istakar. On the
way, he seduces Nourounihar, the beautiful daughter of the Emir Fakreddin, and
carries her with him to the Palace of Eblis, where they are condemned to
wander eternally, with their hearts surrounded with flames.</p>

<p class='c000'>This idea (which is certainly not Oriental, so far as I know) took the fancy
of Byron, who was a great admirer of Vathek, and he has mixed it with genuine
Oriental features in a powerful passage in the Giaour, beginning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But thou, false Infidel! shalt writhe</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath avenging Monkir’s scythe;</div>
      <div class='line'>And from its torment ’scape alone</div>
      <div class='line'>To wander round lost Eblis’ throne;</div>
      <div class='line'>And fire unquenched, unquenchable,</div>
      <div class='line'>Around, within thy heart shall dwell;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor ear can hear, nor tongue can tell</div>
      <div class='line'>The tortures of that inward hell!” &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How errors relative to Eastern matters are perpetuated is illustrated by the
fact that I have seen these lines quoted in some modern philosophical work
as descriptive of the hell in which the Mahommedans believe!</p>

<p class='c000'>Southey, in Thalaba, b. 1. speaks of the Sarsar, “the Icy Wind of Death,”
an expression which he probably borrowed from Vathek.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <cite>The Count of Hamilton’s Fairy Tales.</cite> Class 1.—There is an English
translation among Bohn’s Extra Volumes, written shortly after the first publication
of Galland’s work.</p>

in a juvenile book published about the end of last century, entitled the Pleasing
Instructor.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <cite>The Persian Tales of Inatulla of Delhi.</cite> Published in 1768, by Colonel
Alexander Dow at Edinburgh. A French translation appeared at Amsterdam
in two vols. and in Paris in one vol. (1769). Class 6. Chiefly founded on a
well-known Persian work, of which a more correct, though still incomplete,
version was published in 3 vols., by Jonathan Scott in 1799, under the title of
Bahar Danush, or Garden of Knowledge.</p>

beginning of the present century, but now forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <cite>Oriental Fairy Tales</cite> (London, 1853) Class 4. A series of very pretty
fairy tales, by an anonymous author, in which the scene is laid in the East
(especially Egypt).</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <cite>The Shaving of Shagpat</cite>, by George Meredith. (London, 1855). Class 5.
I prefer this to most other imitations of an Oriental tale.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. <cite>The Thousand and One Humbugs.</cite> Classes 1 and 2. Published in
“Household Words,” vol. xi. (1855) pp. 265–267, 289–292, 313–316. Parodies on
Nos. 1, 195, 6d, and 6e, f.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. <cite>Eastern Tales, by many story-tellers.</cite> Compiled and edited from ancient
and modern authors by Mrs. Valentine, author of “Sea Fights and Land
Battles,” &amp;c. (Chandos Classics).</p>

<p class='c000'>In her preface, the authoress states that the tales “are gathered from both
ancient and modern French, Italian and English sources.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Contains 14 tales, some genuine, others imitations. One “Alischar and
Smaragdine,” is a genuine story of The Nights (No. 41 of our Table), and
is probably taken from Trébutien. Three tales, “Jalaladeen,” “Haschem,”
and “Jussuf,” are Grimm’s imitations, taken probably from the composite
English edition of 1847, and with the same illustrations. “The Seven
Sleepers,” and the “Four Talismans,” are from the Count de Caylus’ tales;
“Halechalbe” and “Bohetzad” (our No. 174) are from Chavis and Cazotte;
“The Enchanters,” and “Urad” are from the “Tales of the Genii;” and “The
Pantofles” is the well known story of the miser Casem and his slippers, but I
know not where it first appeared. The remaining three tales are unknown to
me, and as I have seen no volume of Italian Oriental tales, some, no doubt, are
derived from the Italian sources of which the authoress spoke. They are
the following: “The Prince and the Lions,” “The City of the Demons” (a
Jewish story purporting to have been written in England) and “Sadik Beg.”</p>

<p class='c000'>11. <cite>New Arabian Nights</cite>, by R. L. Stevenson. (London, 1882.)</p>

<p class='c000'>12. <cite>More New Arabian Nights. The Dynamiter.</cite> By R. L. Stevenson and
Vander Grift (London, 1882). Class 4.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these tales, Sir R. F. Burton observes, “The only visible connection with
the old Nights is in the habit of seeking adventures under a disguise. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>method is to make the main idea possible and the details extravagant. In
another ‘New Arabian Nights,’ the joint production of MM. Brookfield, Besant
and Pollock, the reverse treatment is affected, the leading idea being grotesque
and impossible, and the details accurate and life-like.”</p>

<h4 class='c019'>C.—<span class='sc'>German.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is quite possible that there are many imitations in German, but I have
not met with them. I can only mention one or two tales by Hauff (the Caliph
turned Stork, and the Adventures of Said); a story called “Ali and Gulhindi,”
by what author I do not now remember; and some imitations said to be by
Grimm, already mentioned in reference to the English composite edition
of 1847. They are all European fairy tales, in an Eastern dress.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><em>CONCLUSION.</em></h3>

<p class='c018'>Among books specially interesting to the student of The Nights, I may
mention Weil’s “<span lang="de">Biblische Legenden der Muselmänner, aus arabischen Quellen
zusammengetragen, und mit jüdischen Sagen verglichen</span>” (Frankfort-on-Main,
1845). An anonymous English translation appeared in 1846 under the title of
“The Bible, the Koran, and the Talmud,” and it also formed one of the sources
from which the Rev. S. Baring-Gould compiled his “Legends of Old Testament
Characters” (2 vols., 1871). The late Prof. Palmer’s “Life of Haroun Al-Raschid”
(London, 1881), is not much more than a brief popular sketch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The references to The Nights in English and other European literatures
are innumerable; but I cannot refrain from quoting Mark Twain’s identification
of Henry the Eighth with Shahryar (Huckleberry Finn, chap. xxiii.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you ought to see old Henry the Eighth when he was in bloom.
He <em>was</em> a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off
her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs. “Fetch up Nell Gwynne,” he says. They fetch her up.
Next morning, “Chop off her head.” And they chop it off. “Fetch up Jane
Shore,” he says; and up she comes. Next morning, “Chop off her head.”
And they chop it off. “Ring up Fair Rosamun.” Fair Rosamun answers
the bell. Next morning. “Chop off her head.” And he made every one of
them tell him a tale every night, and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and
called it Domesday Book—which was a good name, and stated the case. You
don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them, and this old rip of corn is one of the
cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry, he takes a notion he wants to get
up some trouble with this country. How does he do it—give notice?—give the
country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbour
overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to
come on. That was <em>his</em> style—he never give anybody a chance. He had
suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do?—ask
him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. Spose
people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared
it. Spose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down
there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing.
Spose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn’t shut it up powerful quick
he’d lose a lie, every time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was.”</p>

volumes are indicated throughout, except in the case of some of the texts.
Only those tales in No. 5, not included in No. 4, are here indicated in the

belong to the genuine Nights are marked with an asterisk.</p>

see how, under the late Khedive they managed to take precedence of Europeans who
found themselves in the background before they knew it. For instance, every Bey,
whose degree is that of a Colonel was made an “Excellency” and ranked accordingly
at Court whilst his father, some poor Fellah, was ploughing the ground. Tanfík Pasha
began his ill-omened rule by always placing natives close to him in the place of honour,
addressing them first and otherwise snubbing Europeans who, when English, were often
too obtuse to notice the petty insults lavished upon them.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A quotation from Al-Hariri (Ass. of the Badawin). Ash’ab (ob. A.H. 54), a
Medinite servant of Caliph Osman, was proverbial for greed and sanguine, Micawber-like
expectation of “windfalls.” The Scholiast Al-Sharíshi (of Xeres) describes him in
Theophrastic style. He never saw a man put hand to pocket without expecting a
present, or a funeral go by without hoping for a legacy, or a bridal procession without
preparing his own house, hoping they might bring the bride to him by mistake. * * *
When asked if he knew aught greedier than himself he said “Yes; a sheep I once
kept upon my terrace-roof seeing a rainbow mistook it for a rope of hay and jumping
to seize it broke its neck!” Hence “Ash’ab’s sheep” became a by-word (Preston
tells the tale in full, p. 288).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r127'>127</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This threefold distribution occurred to me many years ago and when far
beyond reach of literary authorities: I was, therefore, much pleased to find the subjoined
threefold classification with minor details made by Baron von Hammer-Purgstall
(Preface to Contes Inédits etc. of G. S. Trébutien, Paris, mdcccxxviii.).
(1) The older stories which serve as a base to the collection, such as the Ten Wazirs
(“Malice of Women”) and Voyages of Sindbad (?) which may date from the days of
Mahommed. These are distributed into two sub-classes; (<em>a</em>) the marvellous and purely
imaginative (<i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Jamasp and the Serpent Queen) and (<em>b</em>) the realistic mixed with
instructive fables and moral instances. (2) The stories and anecdotes peculiarly Arab,
relating to the Caliphs and especially to Al-Rashíd; and (3) The tales of Egyptian provenance,
which mostly date from the times of the puissant “Aaron the Orthodox.” Mr.
John Payne (Villon Translation, vol. ix. pp. 367–73) distributes the stories roughly under
five chief heads as follows: (1) Histories or long Romances, as King Omar bin Al-Nu’man.
(2) Anecdotes or short stories dealing with historical personages and with
incidents and adventures belonging to the every-day life of the period to which they
refer: <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> those concerning Al-Rashíd and Hátim of Tayy. (3) Romances and
romantic fictions comprising three different kinds of tales; (<em>a</em>) purely romantic and
supernatural; (<em>b</em>) fictions and nouvelles with or without a basis and background of
historical fact and (<em>c</em>) <span lang="fr">Contes fantastiques</span>. (4) Fables and Apologues; and (5) Tales
proper, as that of Tawaddud.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r182'>182</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Time-measurers are of very ancient date. The Greeks had <span lang="la">clepsydræ</span> and the
Romans gnomons, portable and ring-shaped, besides large standing town-dials as at
Aquileja and San Sabba near Trieste. The “Saracens” were the perfecters of the
clepsydra: Bosseret (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>) and the Chronicon Turense (Beckmann ii. 340 <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i>) describe
the water-clock sent by Al-Rashid to Karl the Great as a kind of “cuckoo-clock.”
Twelve doors in the dial opened successively and little balls dropping on brazen bells
told the hour: at noon a dozen mounted knights paraded the face and closed the
portals. Trithonius mentions an horologium presented in A.D. 1232 by Al-Malik al-Kámil
the Ayyubite Soldan to the Emperor Frederick II: like the Strasbourg and
Padua clocks it struck the hours, told the day, month and year, showed the phases of
the moon, and registered the position of the sun and the planets. Towards the end of
the fifteenth century Gaspar Visconti mentions in a sonnet the watch proper (<span lang="it">certi
orologii piccioli e portativi</span>); and the “animated eggs” of Nurembourg became famous.
The earliest English watch (Sir Ashton Lever’s) dates from 1541: and in 1544 the portable
chronometer became common in France.</p>

infected with it was pointed out to me at Baroda by my late friend, Dr. Arnott

hippic syphilis, which has been studied in Hungary. Eastern peoples have a practice of
“passing on” venereal and other diseases, and transmission is supposed to cure the
patient; for instance a virgin heals (and catches) gonorrhœa. Syphilis varies greatly
with climate. In Persia it is said to be propagated without contact: in Abyssinia it is
often fatal and in Egypt it is readily cured by sand baths and sulphur-unguents. Lastly
in lands like Unyamwezi, where mercurials are wholly unknown, I never saw caries of
the nasal or facial bones.</p>

more detailed and the style, more correct than that of other MS., is hardly

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r231'>231</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A notable instance of Roman superficiality, incuriousness and ignorance. Every old
Egyptian city had its idols (images of metal, stone or wood), in which the Deity became
incarnate as in the Catholic host; besides its own symbolic animal used as a Kiblah or
prayer-direction (Jerusalem or Meccah), the visible means of fixing and concentrating the
thoughts of the vulgar, like the crystal of the hypnotist or the disk of the electro-biologist.
And goddess Diana was in no way better than goddess Pasht. For the true view of
idolatry see Koran xxxix. 4. I am deeply grateful to Mr. P. le Page Renouf (Soc. of
Biblic. Archæology, April 6, 1886) for identifying the Manibogh, Michabo or Great
Hare of the American indigenes with Osiris Unnefer (“Hare God”). These are the
lines upon which investigation should run. And of late years there is a notable improvement
of tone in treating of symbolism or idolatry: the Lingam and the Yoni are now
described as “mystical representations, and perhaps the best possible impersonal
representatives, of the abstract expressions paternity and maternity” (Prof. Monier
Williams in “Folk-lore Record” vol. iii. part i. p. 118).</p>

the Delphians and his fable beginning, “Once upon a time there was a fight;” while

<div class='footnote' id='f234'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r234'>234</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are three distinct Lokmans who are carefully confounded in Sale (Koran
chapt. xxxi.) and in Smith’s Dict. of Biography etc. art. Æsopus. The first or eldest
Lokman, entitled Al-Hakím (the Sage) and the hero of the Koranic chapter which bears
his name, was son of Bá’úrá of the Children of Azar, sister’s son to Job or son of Job’s
maternal aunt; he witnessed David’s miracles of mail-making and when the tribe of ’Ád
was destroyed, he became King of the country. The second, also called the Sage, was
a slave, an Abyssinian negro, sold to the Israelites during the reign of David or Solomon,
synchronous with the Persian Kay Káús and Kay Khusrau, also Pythagoras the Greek(!).
His physique is alluded to in the saying, “Thou resemblest Lokman (in black ugliness)
but not in wisdom” (Ibn Khallikan i. 145). This negro or negroid, after a godly and
edifying life, left a volume of “Amsál,” proverbs and exempla (not fables or apologues);
and Easterns still say, “One should not pretend to teach Lokmán”—in Persian,
“Hikmat ba Lokman ámokhtan.” Three of his apothegms dwell in the public
memory: “The heart and the tongue are the best and worst parts of the human body.”
“I learned wisdom from the blind who make sure of things by touching them” (as did
St. Thomas); and, when he ate the colocynth offered by his owner, “I have received
from thee so many a sweet that ’twould be surprising if I refused this one bitter.” He
was buried (says the Tárikh Muntakhab) at Ramlah in Judæa, with the seventy Prophets
stoned in one day by the Jews. The youngest Lokman “of the vultures” was a prince
of the tribe of Ad who lived 3,500 years, the age of seven vultures (Tabari). He
could dig a well with his nails; hence the saying, “Stronger than Lokman” (A. P. i. 701);
and he loved the arrow-game, hence “More gambling than Lokman” (ibid. ii. 938).
“More voracious than Lokman” (ibid. i. 134) alludes to his eating one camel for
breakfast and another for supper. His wife Barákish also appears in proverb, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> “Camel
us and camel thyself” (ibid. i. 295) <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> give us camel flesh to eat, said when her son
by a former husband brought her a fine joint which she and her husband relished. Also,
“Barákish hath sinned against her kin” (ibid. ii. 89). More of this in Chenery’s Al-Hariri
p. 422; but the three Lokmans are there reduced to two.</p>

“Panchatantra,” became the Hindu Panchopakhyan, the Hindostani Akhlák-i-Hindi
(“Moralities of Ind”) and in Persia and Turkey the Anvar-i-Suhayli (“Lights of
Canopus”). Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac writers entitle their version Kalílah wa
Damnah, or Kalilaj wa Damnaj, from the name of the two jackal-heroes, and Europe
knows the recueil as the Fables of Pilpay or Bidpay (Bidyá-pati, Lord of learning?)

ways than one. Anepu the elder (Potiphar) understands the language of cattle, an

takes the form of a bull—metamorphosis full blown. It is not, as some have called it,

whose “Rubáh” can never be mistaken for “Shaghál.” “Sa’lab” among the Semites
is locally applied to either beast and we can distinguish the two only by the fox being
solitary and rapacious, and the jackal gregarious and a carrion-eater. In all Hindu
tales the jackal seems to be an awkward substitute for the Grecian and classical fox,
the Giddar or Kolá (<em>Canis aureus</em>) being by no means sly and wily as the Lomri (<em>Vulpes
vulgaris</em>). This is remarked by Weber (<span lang="de">Indische Studien</span>) and Prof. Benfey’s retort
about “King Nobel” the lion is by no means to the point. See Katha Sarit
Sagara, ii. 28.</p>

<p class='c000'>I may add that in Northern Africa jackal’s gall, like jackal’s grape (<em>Solanum nigrum</em> =

“Popular Tales and Fictions; their Migrations and Transformations,” informs me the
first to adapt this witty anecdote was Jacques de Vitry, the crusading bishop of Accon
(Acre) who died at Rome in 1240, after setting the example of “Exempla” or instances
in his sermons. He had probably heard it in Syria, and he changed the day-dreamer
into a Milkmaid and her Milk-pail to suit his “flock.” It then appears as an
“Exemplum” in the Liber de Donis or de Septem Donis (or De Dono Timoris from
Fear the first gift) of Stephanus de Borbone, the Dominican, ob. Lyons, 1261: it treated
of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah xi. 2 and 3), <span lang="la">Timor, Pietas, Scientia, Fortitudo,

and a Night or of its archetype the Hazár Afsánah. He was followed by the Piacevoli
Notti of Giovan Francisco Straparola (A.D. 1550), translated into almost all European
languages but English: the original Italian is now rare. Then came the <span lang="fr">Heptameron

only sister of Francis I. She died in 1549 before the days were finished: in 1558

the “Heptameron.” Next is the Hexameron of A. de Torquemada, Rouen, 1610;
and, lastly, the Pentamerone or El Cunto de li Cunte of Giambattista Basile (Naples,
1637), known by the meagre abstract of J. E. Taylor and the caricatures of George
Cruikshank (London, 1847–50). I propose to translate this Pentamerone direct from the
Neapolitan and have already finished half the work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f297'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r297'>297</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Translated and well annotated by Prof. Tawney, who, however, affects asterisks
and has considerably bowdlerised sundry of the tales, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> the Monkey who picked out
the Wedge (vol. ii. 28). This tale, by the by, is found in the Khirad Afroz (i. 128) and
in the Anwar-i-Suhayli (chapt. i.) and gave rise to the Persian proverb, “What has a
monkey to do with carpentering?” It is curious to compare the Hindu with the Arabic
work whose resemblances are as remarkable as their differences, while even more
notable is their correspondence in impressionising the reader. The Thaumaturgy of
both is the same: the Indian is profuse in demonology and witchcraft; in transformation
and restoration; in monsters as wind-men, fire-men and water-men; in
air-going elephants and flying horses (i. 541–43); in the wishing cow, divine goats
and laughing fishes (i. 24); and in the speciosa miracula of magic weapons. He
delights in fearful battles (i. 400) fought with the same weapons as the Moslem
and rewards his heroes with a “turband of honour” (i. 266) in lieu of a robe.
There is a quaint family likeness arising from similar stages and states of society: the
city is adorned for gladness; men carry money in a robe-corner and exclaim “Ha!
good!” (for “Good, by Allah!”); lovers die with exemplary facility; the “soft-sided”
ladies drink spirits (i. 61) and princesses get drunk (i. 476); whilst the Eunuch, the
Hetaira and the bawd (Kuttini) play the same preponderating parts as in The Nights.
Our Brahman is strong in love-making; he complains of the pains of separation in
this phenomenal universe; he revels in youth, “twin-brother to mirth,” and beauty
which has illuminating powers; he foully reviles old age and he alternately praises and
abuses the sex, concerning which more presently. He delights in truisms, the fashion
of contemporary Europe (see Palmerin of England chapt. vii), such as “It is the
fashion of the heart to receive pleasure from those things which ought to give it,”
etc. etc. What is there the wise cannot understand? and so forth. He is liberal
in trite reflections and frigid conceits (i. 19, 55, 97, 103, 107, in fact everywhere);
and his puns run through whole lines: this in fine Sanskrit style is inevitable.
Yet some of his expressions are admirably terse and telling, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Ascending the
swing of Doubt: Bound together (lovers) by the leash of gazing: Two babes
looking like Misery and Poverty: Old Age seized me by the chin: (A lake) first
assay of the Creator’s skill: (A vow) difficult as standing on a sword-edge: My vital
spirits boiled with the fire of woe: Transparent as a good man’s heart: There was
a certain convent full of fools: Dazed with scripture-reading: The stones could
not help laughing at him: The Moon kissed the laughing forehead of the East:
She was like a wave of the Sea of Love’s insolence (ii. 127), a wave of the Sea of
Beauty tossed up by the breeze of Youth: The King played dice, he loved slave-girls, he
told lies, he sat up o’ nights, he waxed wroth without reason, he took wealth wrongously,
he despised the good and honoured the bad (i. 562); with many choice bits of the same
kind. Like the Arab the Indian is profuse in personification; but the doctrine of preexistence,
of incarnation and emanation and an excessive spiritualism, ever aiming at the
infinite, makes his imagery run mad. Thus we have Immoral Conduct embodied; the
God of Death; Science; the Svarga-heaven; Evening; Untimeliness; and the Earth-bride,
while the Ace and Deuce of dice are turned into a brace of Demons. There is
also that grotesqueness which the French detect even in Shakespeare, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> She drank in
his ambrosial form with thirsty eyes like partridges (i. 476) and it often results from the
comparison of incompatibles, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> a row of birds likened to a garden of nymphs; and
from forced allegories, the favourite figure of contemporary Europe. Again, the rhetorical
Hindu style differs greatly from the sobriety, directness and simplicity of the Arab, whose
motto is Brevity combined with precision, except where the latter falls into “fine
writing.” And, finally, there is a something in the atmosphere of these Tales which is
unfamiliar to the West and which makes them, as more than one has remarked to me,
very hard reading.</p>

on Earth as Vararúchi and Gunádhya and this runs through lib. i. Lib. ii. begins with
the Story of Udáyana to whom we must be truly grateful as our only guide: he and his
son Naraváhanadatta fill up the rest and end with lib. xviii. Thus the want of the clew
or plot compels a division into books, which begin for instance with “We worship the
elephantine proboscis of Ganesha” (lib. x. 1), a reverend and awful object to a Hindu
but to Englishmen mainly suggesting the “Zoo.” The “Bismillah” of The Nights is
much more satisfactory.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f304'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r304'>304</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It began, however, in Persia where the celebrated Darwaysh Mukhlis, Chief Sofi of
Isfahan in the xviith century, translated into Persian tales certain Hindu plays of which a
MS. entitled Alfaraga Badal-Schidda (Al-faraj ba’d al-shiddah = Joy after annoy) exists
in the <span lang="fr">Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris</span>. But to give an original air to his work, he entitled
it “Hazár o yek Ruz” = Thousand and One Days, and in 1675 he allowed his friend
Petis de la Croix, who happened to be at Isfahan, to copy it. <span lang="fr">Le Sage</span> (of Gil Blas)
is said to have converted many of the tales of Mukhlis into comic operas, which were
performed at the Théâtre Italien. I still hope to see The Nights at the Lyceum.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f305'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r305'>305</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This author, however, when hazarding a change of style which is, I think, regretable,
has shown abundant art by filling up the frequent deficiencies of the text after the
fashion of Baron McGuckin de Slane in Ibn Khallikan. As regards the tout ensemble
of his work, a noble piece of English, my opinion will ever be that expressed in my
Foreword. A carping critic has remarked that the translator, “as may be seen in every
page, is no Arabic scholar.” If I be a judge, the reverse is the case: the brilliant and
beautiful version thus traduced is almost entirely free from the blemishes and carelessness
which disfigure Lane’s, and thus it is far more faithful to the original. But it is
no secret that on the staff of that journal the translator of Villon has sundry enemies,
<i><span lang="fr">vrais diables enjupponés</span></i>, who take every opportunity of girding at him because he does
not belong to the clique and because he does good work when theirs is mostly sham.
The sole fault I find with Mr. Payne is that his severe grace of style treats an unclassical
work as a classic, when the romantic and irregular would have been a more appropriate
garb. But this is a mere matter of private judgment.</p>

Ahná and nahná for nahnú, (iv. 370, 372); Aná ba-ashtarí = I will buy (iii. 109): and
Aná ’Ámíl = I will do (v. 367). Alaykí for Alayki (i. 18), Antí for Anti (iii. 66)
and generally long í for short ĭ. ’Ammál (from ’amala = he did) tahlam = certainly
thou dreamest, and ’Ammálín yaakulú = they were about to eat (ix. 315): Aywá for
Ay wa’lláhí = yes, by Allah (passim). Bitá’ = belonging to, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Sára bitá’k = it is
become thine (ix. 352) and Matá’ with the same sense (iii. 80). Dá ’l-khurj = this
saddle-bag (ix. 336) and Dí (for hazah) = this woman (iii. 79) or this time (ii. 162).
Fayn as ráha fayn = whither is he gone? (iv. 323): Kamá badri = he rose early
(ix. 318): Kamán = also, a word known to every European (ii. 43): Katt = never
(ii. 172): Kawám (pronounced ’awám) = fast, at once (iv. 385) and Rih ásif kawí
(pron. ’awí) = a wind, strong very. Laysh, <i><span lang="la">e.g.</span></i> bi-tasalní laysh (ix. 324) = why do you
ask me? a favourite form for li ayya shayyin: so Máfish = má fihi shayyun (there is no
thing) in which Herr Landberg (p. 425) makes “Sha, <span lang="fr">le présent de pouvoir</span>.” Min
ajalí = for my sake; and Li-ajal al-taudí’a = for the sake of taking leave (Mac. Edit.
i. 384). Rijál nautiyah = men sailors when the latter word would suffice: Shuwayh
(dim. of shayy) = a small thing, a little (iv. 309) like Moyyah (dim. of Má) a little
water: Waddúni = they carried me (ii. 172) and lastly the abominable Wáhid gharíb
= one (for a) stranger. These few must suffice: the tale of Judar and his brethren,
which in style is mostly Egyptian, will supply a number of others. It must not,
however, be supposed, as many have done, that vulgar and colloquial Arabic is of
modern date: we find it in the first century of Al-Islam, as is proved by the tale of
Al-Hajjáj and Al-Shabi (Ibn Khallikan, ii. 6). The former asked “Kam ataa-k?”
(= how much is thy pay?) to which the latter answered, “Alfayn!” (= two thousand!).
“Tut,” cried the Governor, “Kam atau-ka?” to which the poet replied as correctly
and classically, “Alfáni.”</p>

Hebrew of the worst type, who condones, permits or commands every sin in the
Decalogue to a Jewish patriarch, <i><span lang="la">quâ</span></i> patriarch. He orders Abraham to murder his son
and allows Jacob to swindle his brother; Moses to slaughter an Egyptian and the Jews to
plunder and spoil a whole people, after inflicting upon them a series of plagues which
would be the height of atrocity if the tale were true. The nations of Canaan are then
extirpated. Ehud, for treacherously disembowelling King Eglon, is made judge over
Israel. Jael is blessed above women (Joshua v. 24) for vilely murdering a sleeping guest;
the horrid deeds of Judith and Esther are made examples to mankind; and David, after an
adultery and a homicide which deserved ignominious death, is suffered to massacre a host
of his enemies, cutting some in two with saws and axes and putting others into brick-kilns.
For obscenity and impurity we have the tales of Onan and Tamar, Lot and his
daughters, Amnon and his fair sister (2 Sam. xiii.), Absalom and his father’s concubines,
the “wife of whoredoms” of Hosea and, capping all, the Song of Solomon. For the horrors
forbidden to the Jews, who, therefore, must have practised them, see Levit. viii. 24; xi. 5;
xvii. 7; xviii. 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 21, 23, and xx. 3. For mere filth what can be fouler
than 1st Kings, xviii. 27; Tobias ii. 11; Esther xiv. 2; Eccl. xxii. 2; Isaiah xxxvi. 12;
Jeremiah iv. 5, and (Ezekiel iv. 12–15), where the Lord changes human ordure into
“Cow-chips!” <span lang="fr">Ce qui excuse Dieu</span>, said Henri Beyle, <span lang="fr">c’est qu’il n’existe pas</span>,—I add,

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r324'>324</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Theodore Christlieb (“Modern Doubt and Christian Relief,” Edinburgh: Clark,
1874) can even now write;—“So then the ‘full age’ to which humanity is at
present supposed to have attained, consists in man’s doing good purely for goodness sake!
Who sees not the hollowness of this bombastic talk. <em>That</em> man has yet to be born whose
practice will be regulated by this insipid theory (<i><span lang="de">dieser grauen Theorie</span></i>). What is the
idea of goodness per se? *&#8196;*&#8196;* The abstract idea of goodness is not an effectual
motive for well-doing” (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>). My only comment is <i><span lang="fr">c’est ignoble!</span></i> His reverence
acts the part of Satan in Holy Writ, “Does Job serve God for naught?” Compare this
selfish, irreligious, and immoral view with Philo Judæus (On the Allegory of the Sacred
Laws, cap. lviii.), to measure the extent of the fall from Pharisaism to Christianity.
And the latter is still infected with the “bribe-and-threat doctrine:” I once immensely
scandalised a Consular Chaplain by quoting the noble belief of the ancients, and it
was some days before he could recover mental equanimity. The degradation is now
inbred.</p>

soul knoweth what joy of the eyes is reserved for the good in recompense for their

much aided by the “Discipline of the Secret,” supposed to be of apostolic origin,
which concealed from neophytes, catechumens and penitents all the higher mysteries,
like the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Metastoicheiosis (transubstantiation), the Real
Presence, the Eucharist and the Seven Sacraments; when Arnobius could ask, <span lang="la">Quid Deo
cum vino est?</span> and when Justin, fearing the charge of Polytheism, could expressly declare
the inferior nature of the Son to the Father. Hence the creed was appropriately called
Symbol, <i><span lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Sign of the Secret. This “mental reservation” lasted till the Edict of
Toleration, issued by Constantine in the fourth century, held Christianity secure when
divulging her “mysteries”; and it allowed Arianism to become <em>the</em> popular creed.</p>

“The Flight.” Stating the case broadly, it has become the practice of modern writers
to look upon Mohammed as an honest enthusiast at Meccah and an unscrupulous
despot at Al-Medinah, a view which appears to me eminently unsound and unfair. In
a private station the Meccan Prophet was famed as a good citizen, <i><span lang="la">teste</span></i> his title Al-Amín
= the Trusty. But when driven from his home by the pagan faction, he became
de facto as de jure a king: nay, a royal pontiff; and the preacher was merged in the
Conqueror of his foes and the Commander of the Faithful. His rule, like that of all
Eastern rulers, was stained with blood; but, assuming as true all the crimes and cruelties
with which Christians charge him and which Moslems confess, they were mere blots upon
a glorious and enthusiastic life, ending in a most exemplary death, compared with the
tissue of horrors and havock which the Law and the Prophets attribute to Moses, to
Joshua, to Samuel and to the patriarchs and prophets by express commandment of Jehovah.</p>

Says the Rev. W. Smith (“Pentateuch” chapt. xiii.), “As the journey (Exodus)
proceeds, so laws originate from the accidents of the way,” and he applies this to successive
decrees (Numbers xxvi. 32–36; xxvii. 8–11 and xxxvi. 1–9) holding it indirect
internal evidence of Mosaic authorship (?) Another tone, however, is used in the case
of Al-Islam. “And now, that he might not stand in awe of his wives any longer, <em>down
comes a revelation</em>” says Ockley in his bluff and homely style, which admits such phrases
as, “the imposter has the impudence to say.” But why, in common honesty, refuse to
the Koran the concessions freely made to the Torah? It is a mere <span lang="la">petitio principii</span> to
argue that the latter is “inspired” while the former is not; moreover, although we may
be called upon to believe things <em>beyond</em> Reason, it is hardly fair to require our belief in
things <em>contrary</em> to Reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>By its love symptoms, suggesting that possession is the sole cure for passion, Erasistratus
discovered the love of Antiochus for Stratonice. Mure (Hist. of Greek Literature,
1850) speaks of the Ode to Aphrodite (Frag. 1) as “one in which the whole volume of
Greek literature offers the most powerful concentration into one brilliant focus of the
modes in which amatory concupiscence can display itself.” But Bernhardy, Bode,
Richter, K. O. Müller and esp. Welcker have made Sappho a model of purity, much
like some of our dull wits who have converted Shakespeare, that most debauched genius,
into a good British bourgeois.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r366'>366</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plato (Symp.) is probably mystical when he accounts for such passions by there
being in the beginning three species of humanity, men, women and men-women or
androgynes. When the latter were destroyed by Zeus for rebellion, the two others were
individually divided into equal parts. Hence each division seeks its other half in the
same sex; the primitive man prefers men and the primitive woman women. <span lang="fr">C’est beau</span>,
but—is it true? The idea was probably derived from Egypt which supplied the Hebrews
with androgynic humanity; and thence it passed to extreme India, where Shiva as
Ardhanárí was male on one side and female on the other side of the body, combining
paternal and maternal qualities and functions. The first creation of humans (Gen. i. 27)
was hermaphrodite (= Hermes and Venus) <span lang="la">masculum et fœminam creavit eos</span>—male and
female created He them—on the sixth day, with the command to increase and multiply
(ibid. v. 28) while Eve the woman was created subsequently. Meanwhile, say certain
Talmudists, Adam carnally copulated with all races of animals. See L’Anandryne in
Mirabeau’s Erotika Biblion, where Antoinette Bourgnon laments the undoubling
which disfigured the work of God, producing monsters incapable of independent self-reproduction
like the vegetable kingdom.</p>

ancestor he would become a local god, like the Hebrew Jehovah as opposed to Chemosh
of Moab; the name would gain amplitude by long time and distant travel and the old
island chieftain would end in becoming the Demiurgus. Ganymede (who possibly gave
rise to the old Lat. “<span lang="la">Catamitus</span>”) was probably some fair Phrygian boy (“son of
Tros”) who in process of time became a symbol of the wise man seized by the eagle
(perspicacity) to be raised amongst the Immortals; and the chaste myth simply signified
that only the prudent are loved by the gods. But it rotted with age as do all things
human. For the Pederastía of the Gods see Bayle under Chrysippe.</p>

conquerors in our eighth century, are mostly nomades and camel-breeders. Third and
last are the Moors proper, the race dwelling in towns, a mixed breed originally Arabian
but modified by six centuries of Spanish residence and showing by thickness of feature
and a parchment-coloured skin, resembling the American Octaroon’s, a negro innervation
of old date. The latter are well described in “Morocco and the Moors,” etc. (Sampson

women because Abel died virginal. Origen mutilated himself after interpreting too
rigorously Matth. xix. 12, and was duly excommunicated. But his disciple, the Arab
Valerius founded (A.D. 250) the castrated sect called Valerians who, persecuted and
dispersed by the Emperors Constantine and Justinian, became the spiritual fathers of the
modern Skopzis. These eunuchs first appeared in Russia at the end of the xith century,
when two Greeks, John and Jephrem, were metropolitans of Kiew: the former was
brought thither in A.D. 1089 by Princess Anna Wassewolodowna and is called by the

ignorant followers believe that he was unable to read and write. His last words, accepted
by all traditionists, were “Aatíní dawáta wa kalam” (bring me ink-case and pen);
upon which the Shi’ah or Persian sectaries base, not without probability, a theory that
Mohammed intended to write down the name of Ali as his Caliph or successor when
Omar, suspecting the intention, exclaimed, “The Prophet is delirious; have we not the
Koran?” thus impiously preventing the precaution. However that may be, the legend
proves that Mohammed could read and write even when not “under inspiration.” The
vulgar idea would arise from a pious intent to add miracle to the miraculous style of the
Koran.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r435'>435</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I cannot but vehemently suspect that this legend was taken from much older traditions.
We have Jubal the semi-mythical who, “by the different falls of his hammer on
the anvil, discovered by the ear the first rude music that pleased the antediluvian
fathers.” Then came Pythagoras, of whom Macrobius (lib. ii.) relates how this Græco-Egyptian
philosopher, passing by a smithy, observed that the sounds were grave or
acute according to the weights of the hammers; and he ascertained by experiment
that such was the case when different weights were hung by strings of the same size.
The next discovery was that two strings of the same substance and tension, the one
being double the length of the other, gave the diapason-interval or an eighth; and the
same was effected from two strings of similar length and size, the one having four times
the tension of the other. Belonging to the same cycle of invention-anecdotes are
Galileo’s discovery of the pendulum by the lustre of the Pisan Duomo; and the kettle-lid,
the falling apple and the copper hook which inspired Watt, Newton and Galvani.</p>

(i. 114). A poet addressing a single individual does not say “My friend!” or “My

companions, one to tend the sheep and the other to pasture the camels.</p>

The most notable point in Arabic verse is its savage satire, the language of excited
